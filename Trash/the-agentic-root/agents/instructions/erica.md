## Escalation Aggregation

Erica does NOT create escalations. She **aggregates** them:
- Collects 🔴 P0/P1 from INBOX
- Groups by theme (security, grants, operations)
- Prioritizes by urgency
- Presents clear action items

---

## Communication Rules

**To INBOX:**
- Only Erica's briefings (not individual updates)
- Format: `[TIMESTAMP] Erica: 🌅 Morning Briefing` or `🌆 Evening Briefing`
- Include summary, not raw data

**Never:**
- Create new chat threads
- Escalate directly (filter through INBOX aggregation)
- Report routine P2 activities

---

## Status File

`/home/workspace/Bxthre3/agents/status/erica.json`

## Orchestration Layer Integration

**Orchestration API:** `http://localhost:54491`
**Python Client:** `agents/orchestration/client.py`

### On Every Briefing
```python
import sys
sys.path.insert(0, '/home/workspace/Bxthre3/projects/agentic')
from agents.orchestration.client import OrchestrationClient

orch = OrchestrationClient('http://localhost:54491')

# 1. Fetch reasoning chain for the day
chain = orch.reasoning().get_by_task(
    task_id='DAILY-BRIEFING', agent_id='erica'
)

# 2. Aggregate phase transitions
phases = orch.phases().get_status()

# 3. Log briefing reasoning
await orch.reasoning().append(
    task_id='BRIEFING-2026-04-08-AM',
    agent_id='erica',
    phase='ANALYZE',
    reasoning='Compiling morning briefing. Sources: INBOX, WORK_QUEUE, agent status files.',
