# 🗺️ Agent OS v2.0 Implementation Roadmap
**Strategic, Coordinated Rollout with GitHub Version Control**

---

## Overview

Transform Agent OS v1.0 → v2.0 through 4 coordinated phases.
Each phase is a GitHub milestone with PRs, reviews, and rollback capability.

---

## Git Strategy

```
main (stable)
  └── develop (integration)
        ├── feature/auto-execute
        ├── feature/github-webhooks
        ├── feature/supermemory-integration
        ├── feature/priority-scheduling
        └── feature/cost-optimization
```

**Branch Rules:**
- All changes via PR to `develop`
- `main` only via merge from `develop`
- Each feature branch = one improvement
- PR requires: tests pass, docs updated, inbox log entry

---

## Phase 1: Foundation Hardening (Week 1)
**Goal:** Make the system robust before adding complexity

### 1.1 GitHub Repository Setup
- [ ] Initialize `bxthre3inc/agentic` repo
- [ ] Migrate all agent files from workspace
- [ ] Set up CI/CD for deployment
- [ ] Create PR template

### 1.2 Testing Infrastructure
- [ ] Create agent test harness
- [ ] Mock work queue for safe testing
- [ ] Add health check endpoint

### 1.3 Documentation
- [ ] API documentation
- [ ] Employee handbook updates
- [ ] Runbook for manual intervention

**Deliverable:** `v1.1-stable` tag on main

---

## Phase 2: Auto-Execution (Week 2)
**Goal:** 70% reduction in manual review load

### 2.1 Safe Task Classification
- [ ] Define "safe" vs "requires approval" taxonomy
- [ ] Risk scoring algorithm (complexity × impact × reversibility)
- [ ] Safe task list: formatting, dead links, obvious secrets, typos

### 2.2 Auto-Execute Implementation
- [ ] Update Sentinel to auto-fix dev secrets
- [ ] Update Alex to auto-sync doc formatting
- [ ] Update Pulse to auto-restart services (if safe)

### 2.3 Audit Trail
- [ ] Every auto-action logged with diff
- [ ] Undo capability for 24 hours
- [ ] Escalation if auto-fix fails

**Deliverable:** `v1.2-auto` - Safe tasks execute without you

---

## Phase 3: Event-Driven Architecture (Week 3)
**Goal:** Real-time response vs polling

### 3.1 GitHub Webhook Integration
- [ ] Configure GitHub webhook endpoints
- [ ] Push event → Drew code review task
- [ ] PR opened → Auto-assign reviewer
- [ ] Issue created → Triage and route

### 3.2 File Watcher System
- [ ] Inotify/fs.watch on key directories
- [ ] Doc changes → Alex verification task
- [ ] Config changes → Pulse validation task

### 3.3 External API Polling
- [ ] Grant deadline APIs (grants.gov, etc.)
- [ ] Patent office RSS feeds
- [ ] Reduce Casey/Iris polling frequency

**Deliverable:** `v1.3-event` - Agents respond to events, not schedules

---

## Phase 4: Intelligence Layer (Week 4)
**Goal:** System manages itself

### 4.1 Priority-Weighted Scheduling
- [ ] Deadline proximity scoring
- [ ] Dynamic agent frequency adjustment
- [ ] Queue depth monitoring

### 4.2 Supermemory Integration
- [ ] Chronicler feeds Skills/supermemory/
- [ ] Pattern recognition (your decision style)
- [ ] Preference learning (grant writing style, code review patterns)

### 4.3 Cost Optimization
- [ ] Model selection based on task complexity
- [ ] Usage tracking and budgeting
- [ ] Auto-downgrade routine tasks

**Deliverable:** `v2.0-intelligent` - Full autonomous operation

---

## Phase 5: Polish & Scale (Week 5)
**Goal:** Production-ready with monitoring

### 5.1 Dashboard v2
- [ ] Real-time task flow visualization
- [ ] Agent performance metrics
- [ ] Cost tracking dashboard

### 5.2 Mobile Integration
- [ ] P0 SMS alerts
- [ ] Telegram integration (optional)
- [ ] Quick approve/reject flows

### 5.3 Documentation & Runbook
- [ ] Video walkthrough
- [ ] Troubleshooting guide
- [ ] Migration guide for new employees

**Deliverable:** `v2.1-production` - Fully documented, monitored, scalable

## Immediate Next Steps (Phase 1.1)

1. **Create GitHub repo** `bxthre3inc/agentic`
2. **Commit initial state** - all files from `/home/workspace/Bxthre3/agents/`
3. **Set up branch protection** - require PR reviews
4. **Create first feature branch** `feature/foundation-tests`

Ready to begin Phase 1?
