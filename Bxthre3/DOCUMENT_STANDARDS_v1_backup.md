# PART II: AGENTOS DOCUMENTATION FRAMEWORK

> **Principle:** Separate **Platform** (what runs AgentOS) from **Capabilities** (what it does)

---

# PART II: AGENTOS POSITIONING — INTERNAL INFRASTRUCTURE

> **AgentOS is not a product.** It is the internal force multiplier that builds and runs products.
> **Analogy:** IBM Watson — impressive technology that demonstrated capability, but primarily served as internal infrastructure and competitive advantage, not a standalone SKU.

## What AgentOS Is

| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Nature** | Internal AI workforce orchestration platform |
| **Purpose** | Force multiplier for Bxthre3 ventures |
| **Users** | Bxthre3 agents, employees, contractors |
| **Value** | Speed, consistency, 24/7 execution, zero-hallucination quality |
| **Revenue** | Indirect — enables products that generate revenue |

## What AgentOS Is NOT

| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **NOT a product** | Not sold to customers, not licensed, not SaaS |
| **NOT a venture** | No P&L, no fundraising round, no separate equity structure |
| **NOT external** | Not marketed to enterprises as "AI workforce solution" |
| **NOT open source** | Core IP, proprietary to Bxthre3 |

## External Positioning (For Clout/Investment)

**How we talk about it publicly:**

> *"Bxthre3 operates its own AI workforce orchestration platform — AgentOS — that enables our 18 AI agents to work 24/7 across all ventures. This internal capability accelerates execution, ensures quality standards, and gives us unfair advantage in speed-to-market."*

**What investors see:**
- Demo of agents working in parallel
- Quality gates (zero hallucination enforcement)
- Speed metrics vs. traditional human-only teams
- Infrastructure moat — not easily replicated

**What we do NOT say:**
- ❌ "AgentOS is our next product"
- ❌ "We're building AgentOS to sell to enterprises"
- ❌ "AgentOS is a standalone business unit"

## Document Implications

| Type | Location | Contains |
|------|----------|----------|
| **AgentOS Platform Docs** | `the-agentos-project/docs/` | Internal architecture, NOT customer-facing |
| **AgentOS Demos** | `the-agentos-project/demos/` | Investor demos, NOT product marketing |
| **Agent PRs** | `the-agentos-project/press/` | Capability announcements, NOT product launches |

## PART III: SEPARATION OF CONCERNS

## Platform vs Capabilities

| Aspect | Platform (AOS-*) | Capabilities (Project Docs) |
|--------|------------------|----------------------------|
| **What** | How AgentOS runs | What AgentOS agents DO |
| **Why** | Foundation/execution layer | Business value/ventures |
| **Who owns** | AgentOS team | Venture leads |
| **Stability** | Slow, careful changes | Fast iteration |
| **Tests** | CI/CD blocking | Integration tests |
| **Docs in** | `the-agentos-project/docs/` | `projects/{name}/` |
| **Breaking** | All agents affected | One venture affected |
| **Versioning** | Semantic (v1.0.0) | Iterative (v1, v2) |
| **Approval** | CTO + brodiblanco | Venture lead |

## Coherence Rules

1. **Platform changes flow OUT** → never depend on venture-specific implementations
2. **Capabilities compose UP** → use platform primitives, don't recreate them
3. **No circular deps** → Platform doesn't know about Specific Product Specs
4. **Interface contracts only** → Capabilities see platform through APIs, not internals
5. **Version lock platform** → Capabilities declare which AOS version they target
6. **Upgrade path defined** → When AOS updates, capability upgrade steps documented

## Document Quality Gates

Before ANY document ships:
1. [ ] Type matches template
2. [ ] Required sections complete
3. [ ] Sources cited ≥90%
4. [ ] No `[VERIFY]` tags remaining
5. [ ] Dependencies declared
6. [ ] Approved by authority
7. [ ] Stored in canonical location

**Universal truth:** *If it doesn't meet the standard, it doesn't exist.*

1. **Platform changes flow OUT** → never depend on venture-specific implementations
2. **Capabilities compose UP** → use platform primitives, don't recreate them
3. **No circular deps** → Platform doesn't know about Specific Product Specs
4. **Interface contracts only** → Capabilities see platform through APIs, not internals
5. **Version lock platform** → Capabilities declare which AOS version they target
6. **Upgrade path defined** → When AOS updates, capability upgrade steps documented

## Document Quality Gates

Before ANY document ships:
1. [ ] Type matches template
2. [ ] Required sections complete
3. [ ] Sources cited ≥90%
4. [ ] No `[VERIFY]` tags remaining
5. [ ] Dependencies declared
6. [ ] Approved by authority
7. [ ] Stored in canonical location

**Universal truth:** *If it doesn't meet the standard, it doesn't exist.*

# PART II: AGENTOS DOCUMENTATION FRAMEWORK

> **Principle:** Separate **Platform** (what runs AgentOS) from **Capabilities** (what it does)

## PART III: SEPARATION OF CONCERNS

## Platform vs Capabilities

| Aspect | Platform (AOS-*) | Capabilities (Project Docs) |
|--------|------------------|----------------------------|
| **What** | How AgentOS runs | What AgentOS agents DO |
| **Why** | Foundation/execution layer | Business value/ventures |
| **Who owns** | AgentOS team | Venture leads |
| **Stability** | Slow, careful changes | Fast iteration |
| **Tests** | CI/CD blocking | Integration tests |
| **Docs in** | `the-agentos-project/docs/` | `projects/{name}/` |
| **Breaking** | All agents affected | One venture affected |
| **Versioning** | Semantic (v1.0.0) | Iterative (v1, v2) |
| **Approval** | CTO + brodiblanco | Venture lead |

## Coherence Rules

1. **Platform changes flow OUT** → never depend on venture-specific implementations
2. **Capabilities compose UP** → use platform primitives, don't recreate them
3. **No circular deps** → Platform doesn't know about Specific Product Specs
4. **Interface contracts only** → Capabilities see platform through APIs, not internals
5. **Version lock platform** → Capabilities declare which AOS version they target
6. **Upgrade path defined** → When AOS updates, capability upgrade steps documented

# PART II: AGENTOS DOCUMENTATION FRAMEWORK

> **Principle:** Separate **Platform** (what runs AgentOS) from **Capabilities** (what it does)

## DOCUMENT CATEGORIES

### 1. AGENTOS PLATFORM (The Engine)

These documents define AgentOS itself — how it runs, is built, and maintains coherence.

| Type | Code | Location | Purpose |

| **AgentOS Build Spec** | AOS-BUILD | `the-agentos-project/docs/BUILD-SPEC.md` | How to build/deploy AgentOS |
| **Agent Def Spec** | AGENT-DEF | `the-agentos-project/docs/AGENT-SPEC.md` | Standard for defining agents |
| **Task Schema** | TASK-SCHEMA | `the-agentos-project/schemas/task.yaml` | Task structure, validation |
| **Platform BOM** | AOS-BOM | `the-agentos-project/docs/BOM.md` | Infra parts, services, deps |
| **API Contract** | AOS-API | `the-agentos-project/api/*.ts` + specs | All endpoints documented |

| **Dependency Map** | AOS-DEPS | `the-agentos-project/docs/DEPS.md` | External deps + versions |

---

### 2. AGENTOS CAPABILITIES (The Work)

These documents define what AgentOS agents DO — products, projects, operations.

| Type | Code | Location | Purpose |
|------|------|----------|---------|
| **Product Spec** | SPEC | `projects/{name}/SPEC-{code}-v{N}.md` | What product is/does |
| **Hardware Spec** | HW-SPEC | `projects/{name}/hardware/SPEC.md` | Physical product reqs |
| **Software Spec** | SW-SPEC | `projects/{name}/software/SPEC.md` | Code/module reqs |

## PART III: SEPARATION OF CONCERNS

## Platform vs Capabilities

| Aspect | Platform (AOS-*) | Capabilities (Project Docs) |
|--------|------------------|----------------------------|
| **What** | How AgentOS runs | What AgentOS agents DO |
| **Why** | Foundation/execution layer | Business value/ventures |
| **Who owns** | AgentOS team | Venture leads |
| **Stability** | Slow, careful changes | Fast iteration |
| **Tests** | CI/CD blocking | Integration tests |
| **Docs in** | `the-agentos-project/docs/` | `projects/{name}/` |
| **Breaking** | All agents affected | One venture affected |
| **Versioning** | Semantic (v1.0.0) | Iterative (v1, v2) |
| **Approval** | CTO + brodiblanco | Venture lead |

## Coherence Rules

1. **Platform changes flow OUT** → never depend on venture-specific implementations
2. **Capabilities compose UP** → use platform primitives, don't recreate them
3. **No circular deps** → Platform doesn't know about Specific Product Specs
4. **Interface contracts only** → Capabilities see platform through APIs, not internals
5. **Version lock platform** → Capabilities declare which AOS version they target
6. **Upgrade path defined** → When AOS updates, capability upgrade steps documented

## Document Quality Gates

Before ANY document ships:
1. [ ] Type matches template
2. [ ] Required sections complete
3. [ ] Sources cited ≥90%
4. [ ] No `[VERIFY]` tags remaining
5. [ ] Dependencies declared
6. [ ] Approved by authority
7. [ ] Stored in canonical location

**Universal truth:** *If it doesn't meet the standard, it doesn't exist.*

# PART II: AGENTOS DOCUMENTATION FRAMEWORK

> **Principle:** Separate **Platform** (what runs AgentOS) from **Capabilities** (what it does)

## DOCUMENT CATEGORIES

### 1. AGENTOS PLATFORM (The Engine)

These documents define AgentOS itself — how it runs, is built, and maintains coherence.

### 2. AGENTOS CAPABILITIES (The Work)

These documents define what AgentOS agents DO — products, projects, operations.

| Type | Code | Location | Purpose |
|------|------|----------|---------|
| **Product Spec** | SPEC | `projects/{name}/SPEC-{code}-v{N}.md` | What product is/does |

## PART III: SEPARATION OF CONCERNS

## Platform vs Capabilities

| Aspect | Platform (AOS-*) | Capabilities (Project Docs) |
|--------|------------------|----------------------------|
| **What** | How AgentOS runs | What AgentOS agents DO |
| **Why** | Foundation/execution layer | Business value/ventures |
| **Who owns** | AgentOS team | Venture leads |
| **Stability** | Slow, careful changes | Fast iteration |
| **Tests** | CI/CD blocking | Integration tests |
| **Docs in** | `the-agentos-project/docs/` | `projects/{name}/` |
| **Breaking** | All agents affected | One venture affected |
| **Versioning** | Semantic (v1.0.0) | Iterative (v1, v2) |
| **Approval** | CTO + brodiblanco | Venture lead |

## Coherence Rules

1. **Platform changes flow OUT** → never depend on venture-specific implementations
2. **Capabilities compose UP** → use platform primitives, don't recreate them
3. **No circular deps** → Platform doesn't know about Specific Product Specs
4. **Interface contracts only** → Capabilities see platform through APIs, not internals
5. **Version lock platform** → Capabilities declare which AOS version they target
6. **Upgrade path defined** → When AOS updates, capability upgrade steps documented

## Document Quality Gates

Before ANY document ships:
1. [ ] Type matches template
2. [ ] Required sections complete
3. [ ] Sources cited ≥90%
4. [ ] No `[VERIFY]` tags remaining
5. [ ] Dependencies declared
6. [ ] Approved by authority
7. [ ] Stored in canonical location

**Universal truth:** *If it doesn't meet the standard, it doesn't exist.*

# PART II: AGENTOS DOCUMENTATION FRAMEWORK

> **Principle:** Separate **Platform** (what runs AgentOS) from **Capabilities** (what it does)

## DOCUMENT CATEGORIES

### 1. AGENTOS PLATFORM (The Engine)

These documents define AgentOS itself — how it runs, is built, and maintains coherence.

| Type | Code | Location | Purpose |

### 2. AGENTOS CAPABILITIES (The Work)

These documents define what AgentOS agents DO — products, projects, operations.

| Type | Code | Location | Purpose |
|------|------|----------|---------|
| **Product Spec** | SPEC | `projects/{name}/SPEC-{code}-v{N}.md` | What product is/does |
| **Hardware Spec** | HW-SPEC | `projects/{name}/hardware/SPEC.md` | Physical product reqs |

## PART III: SEPARATION OF CONCERNS

## Platform vs Capabilities

| Aspect | Platform (AOS-*) | Capabilities (Project Docs) |
|--------|------------------|----------------------------|
| **What** | How AgentOS runs | What AgentOS agents DO |
| **Why** | Foundation/execution layer | Business value/ventures |
| **Who owns** | AgentOS team | Venture leads |
| **Stability** | Slow, careful changes | Fast iteration |
| **Tests** | CI/CD blocking | Integration tests |
| **Docs in** | `the-agentos-project/docs/` | `projects/{name}/` |
| **Breaking** | All agents affected | One venture affected |
| **Versioning** | Semantic (v1.0.0) | Iterative (v1, v2) |
| **Approval** | CTO + brodiblanco | Venture lead |

## Coherence Rules

1. **Platform changes flow OUT** → never depend on venture-specific implementations
2. **Capabilities compose UP** → use platform primitives, don't recreate them
3. **No circular deps** → Platform doesn't know about Specific Product Specs
4. **Interface contracts only** → Capabilities see platform through APIs, not internals
5. **Version lock platform** → Capabilities declare which AOS version they target
6. **Upgrade path defined** → When AOS updates, capability upgrade steps documented

## Document Quality Gates

Before ANY document ships:
1. [ ] Type matches template
2. [ ] Required sections complete
3. [ ] Sources cited ≥90%
4. [ ] No `[VERIFY]` tags remaining
5. [ ] Dependencies declared
6. [ ] Approved by authority
7. [ ] Stored in canonical location

**Universal truth:** *If it doesn't meet the standard, it doesn't exist.*

# PART II: AGENTOS DOCUMENTATION FRAMEWORK

> **Principle:** Separate **Platform** (what runs AgentOS) from **Capabilities** (what it does)

## DOCUMENT CATEGORIES

### 1. AGENTOS PLATFORM (The Engine)

These documents define AgentOS itself — how it runs, is built, and maintains coherence.

| Type | Code | Location | Purpose |

| **Dependency Map** | AOS-DEPS | `the-agentos-project/docs/DEPS.md` | External deps + versions |

---

### 2. AGENTOS CAPABILITIES (The Work)

These documents define what AgentOS agents DO — products, projects, operations.

| Type | Code | Location | Purpose |
|------|------|----------|---------|
| **Product Spec** | SPEC | `projects/{name}/SPEC-{code}-v{N}.md` | What product is/does |
| **Hardware Spec** | HW-SPEC | `projects/{name}/hardware/SPEC.md` | Physical product reqs |
| **Software Spec** | SW-SPEC | `projects/{name}/software/SPEC.md` | Code/module reqs |
| **Architecture** | ARCH | `projects/{name}/ARCHITECTURE.md` | Product technical design |

## PART III: SEPARATION OF CONCERNS

## Platform vs Capabilities

| Aspect | Platform (AOS-*) | Capabilities (Project Docs) |
|--------|------------------|----------------------------|
| **What** | How AgentOS runs | What AgentOS agents DO |
| **Why** | Foundation/execution layer | Business value/ventures |
| **Who owns** | AgentOS team | Venture leads |
| **Stability** | Slow, careful changes | Fast iteration |
| **Tests** | CI/CD blocking | Integration tests |
| **Docs in** | `the-agentos-project/docs/` | `projects/{name}/` |
| **Breaking** | All agents affected | One venture affected |
| **Versioning** | Semantic (v1.0.0) | Iterative (v1, v2) |
| **Approval** | CTO + brodiblanco | Venture lead |

## Coherence Rules

1. **Platform changes flow OUT** → never depend on venture-specific implementations
2. **Capabilities compose UP** → use platform primitives, don't recreate them
3. **No circular deps** → Platform doesn't know about Specific Product Specs
4. **Interface contracts only** → Capabilities see platform through APIs, not internals
5. **Version lock platform** → Capabilities declare which AOS version they target
6. **Upgrade path defined** → When AOS updates, capability upgrade steps documented

## Document Quality Gates

Before ANY document ships:
1. [ ] Type matches template
2. [ ] Required sections complete
3. [ ] Sources cited ≥90%
4. [ ] No `[VERIFY]` tags remaining
5. [ ] Dependencies declared
6. [ ] Approved by authority
7. [ ] Stored in canonical location

**Universal truth:** *If it doesn't meet the standard, it doesn't exist.*

# PART II: AGENTOS DOCUMENTATION FRAMEWORK

> **Principle:** Separate **Platform** (what runs AgentOS) from **Capabilities** (what it does)

---

## DOCUMENT CATEGORIES

### 1. AGENTOS PLATFORM (The Engine)

These documents define AgentOS itself — how it runs, is built, and maintains coherence.

| Type | Code | Location | Purpose |
|------|------|----------|---------|
| **Platform Architecture** | AOS-ARCH | `the-agentos-project/docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` | System design, APIs, data flows |
| **AgentOS Build Spec** | AOS-BUILD | `the-agentos-project/docs/BUILD-SPEC.md` | How to build/deploy AgentOS |
| **Agent Def Spec** | AGENT-DEF | `the-agentos-project/docs/AGENT-SPEC.md` | Standard for defining agents |
| **Task Schema** | TASK-SCHEMA | `the-agentos-project/schemas/task.yaml` | Task structure, validation |
| **Platform BOM** | AOS-BOM | `the-agentos-project/docs/BOM.md` | Infra parts, services, deps |
| **API Contract** | AOS-API | `the-agentos-project/api/*.ts` + specs | All endpoints documented |
| **Release Notes** | AOS-REL | `releases/v{X.Y.Z}.md` | What's in each version |
| **Dependency Map** | AOS-DEPS | `the-agentos-project/docs/DEPS.md` | External deps + versions |

---

### 2. AGENTOS CAPABILITIES (The Work)

These documents define what AgentOS agents DO — products, projects, operations.

| Type | Code | Location | Purpose |
|------|------|----------|---------|
| **Product Spec** | SPEC | `projects/{name}/SPEC-{code}-v{N}.md` | What product is/does |
| **Hardware Spec** | HW-SPEC | `projects/{name}/hardware/SPEC.md` | Physical product reqs |
| **Software Spec** | SW-SPEC | `projects/{name}/software/SPEC.md` | Code/module reqs |
| **Architecture** | ARCH | `projects/{name}/ARCHITECTURE.md` | Product technical design |
| **Build-Out Docs** | BUILD | `projects/{name}/build-out/*.md` | Site/facility construction |
| **BOM Electronics** | BOM-E | `projects/{name}/BOM/electronics.csv` | PCBs, sensors |
| **BOM Mechanical** | BOM-M | `projects/{name}/BOM/mechanical.csv` | Enclosures, mounts |
| **BOM Consumables** | BOM-C | `projects/{name}/BOM/consumables.csv` | Items consumed |
| **BOM Infra** | BOM-I | `projects/{name}/BOM/infrastructure.csv` | Server, network, facility |
| **Business Plan** | BIZ | `projects/{name}/BUSINESS-PLAN.md` | Market, model, financials |
| **Go-to-Market** | GTM | `projects/{name}/GTM.md` | Launch strategy |
| **SOP** | SOP | `projects/{name}/SOPs/{proc}.md` | Standard procedures |
| **Agent Spec** | AG-SPEC | `projects/{name}/agents/{agent}.md` | Agent instructions |
| **Task Definition** | TASK | `INBOX/tasks/{id}.md` | Specific work assignments |
| **Structured Output** | SOUT | `projects/{name}/outputs/{type}.json` | Machine-readable deliverable |
| **Dependency Spec** | PROJ-DEPS | `projects/{name}/DEPS-v{VERSION}.md` | What project needs from others |
| **Business Plan** | BIZ | `projects/{name}/BUSINESS-PLAN.md` | Market, model, financials |
| **Go-to-Market** | GTM | `projects/{name}/GTM.md` | Launch strategy |

## PART III: SEPARATION OF CONCERNS

## Platform vs Capabilities

| Aspect | Platform (AOS-*) | Capabilities (Project Docs) |
|--------|------------------|----------------------------|
| **What** | How AgentOS runs | What AgentOS agents DO |
| **Why** | Foundation/execution layer | Business value/ventures |
| **Who owns** | AgentOS team | Venture leads |
| **Stability** | Slow, careful changes | Fast iteration |
| **Tests** | CI/CD blocking | Integration tests |
| **Docs in** | `the-agentos-project/docs/` | `projects/{name}/` |
| **Breaking** | All agents affected | One venture affected |
| **Versioning** | Semantic (v1.0.0) | Iterative (v1, v2) |
| **Approval** | CTO + brodiblanco | Venture lead |

## Coherence Rules

1. **Platform changes flow OUT** → never depend on venture-specific implementations
2. **Capabilities compose UP** → use platform primitives, don't recreate them
3. **No circular deps** → Platform doesn't know about Specific Product Specs
4. **Interface contracts only** → Capabilities see platform through APIs, not internals
5. **Version lock platform** → Capabilities declare which AOS version they target
6. **Upgrade path defined** → When AOS updates, capability upgrade steps documented

## Document Quality Gates

Before ANY document ships:
1. [ ] Type matches template
2. [ ] Required sections complete
3. [ ] Sources cited ≥90%
4. [ ] No `[VERIFY]` tags remaining
5. [ ] Dependencies declared
6. [ ] Approved by authority
7. [ ] Stored in canonical location

**Universal truth:** *If it doesn't meet the standard, it doesn't exist.*
