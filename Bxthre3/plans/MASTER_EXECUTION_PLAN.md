# Master Execution Plan: AgentOS + Zo + Antigravity
**Date:** 2026-03-29

---

## Priority Matrix

| Priority | System | Phase | Deliverable | Impact |
|----------|--------|-------|-------------|--------|
| P0 | AgentOS↔Zo | Phase 2 | Event Streaming | HIGH - Real-time sync |
| P0 | AgentOS↔Zo | Phase 3 | Agent Delegation | HIGH - Cross-system workflows |
| P1 | AgentOS↔Zo | Phase 4-6 | War Room, File Sync, Notifications | MED - Consolidation |
| P1 | Antigravity | Phase 1 | MCP Server (when API available) | HIGH - Unlock IDE |
| P2 | All | Phase 5+ | Full Mesh | MED - Nice to have |

## Immediate Next Steps (This Week)

### 1. AgentOS↔Zo Event Streaming (Days 1-2)
```
Tasks:
- Add WebSocket endpoint to bridge
- Create event types: inbox.new, task.escalated, agent.offline
- AgentOS worker subscribes to Zo events
- Queue events when bridge down (offline resilience)
```

### 2. Agent Delegation Loop (Days 3-4)
```
Tasks:
- AgentOS agent calls zo_ask for research
- Results auto-create AgentOS tasks
- Zo can create AgentOS tasks via API
- Test: Research → Task created → Agent assigned
```

### 3. Unified Notifications (Day 5)
```
Tasks:
- /notify endpoint with rules engine
- P1 → SMS, P2 → Email, P3 → Inbox
- Cross-system deduplication
- Test: Escalation → SMS sent
```

## Antigravity Blocked
**Status:** Waiting for Google API

**Unblocked work:**
- Design MCP server architecture
- Map Antigravity concepts → AgentOS concepts
- Create skill templates

## Resource Estimates

| Phase | Days | Blockers |
|-------|------|----------|
| Bridge Phase 2 | 2 | None |
| Bridge Phase 3 | 2 | None |
| Bridge Phase 4-6 | 5 | None |
| Antigravity Phase 1 | ? | Google API |
| Full Mesh | 5 | Phase 1-3 done |

**Total unblocked work:** ~9 days
**Total with Antigravity:** ~14 days

## Success Criteria

- [ ] <100ms tool call latency
- [ ] <5s event propagation
- [ ] 99% uptime (bridge)
- [ ] Handles 1000 events/day
- [ ] Zero data loss on outage

---

## Start Next
**Recommendation:** Begin Phase 2 (Event Streaming) — foundation is live, no blockers.
