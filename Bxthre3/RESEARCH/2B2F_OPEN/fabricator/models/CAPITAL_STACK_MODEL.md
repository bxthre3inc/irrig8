2. **Non-Consolidation Opinion:** Legal separation for creditor protection
3. **Arm's Length Pricing:** All intercompany transactions at market rates
4. **Separate Boards:** Independent directors for each OpCo

### Liability Isolation

|-----------|----------|-----|---------|
| Product Liability | Product insurance: $5M | Gaming bond: $750K | E&O: $2M |
| Regulatory Fines | N/A | State bonds: $500K | N/A |
| IP Infringement | IP insurance: $3M | IP insurance: $2M | IP insurance: $5M |
| Data Breach | Cyber: $5M | Cyber: $3M | Cyber: $5M |

| VPC | $750K | $1.5M | $750K | $3M |
| AgentOS | $250K | $500K | $250K | $1M |

| Founder Note | $1M | 6% | Subordinated |
