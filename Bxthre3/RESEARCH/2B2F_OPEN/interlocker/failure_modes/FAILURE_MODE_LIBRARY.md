## Integration Cascade (IC)

### IC-01: Zoe-Dependent Cascade

**Description:** Zoe AI service outage cascades to all OpCos that depend on its reasoning capabilities.

**Trigger Conditions:**
- Zoe API availability < 95%
- Response latency > 5 seconds sustained
- Critical error rate > 1%

**Impact Assessment:**
| OpCo | Function Affected | Severity | Recovery Mode |
|------|------------------|----------|---------------|
| Irrig8 | Predictive alerts | High | Rule-based fallback |
| VPC | Customer support | Medium | Human escalation |
| AgentOS | Task routing | Critical | Static routing table |

**Mitigation:**
1. Graceful degradation protocols
2. Local caching of common responses
3. Circuit breaker pattern implementation
4. Human escalation thresholds

**Recovery Protocol:**
- **Automated:** 15 minutes (failover to backup model)
- **Manual:** 2 hours (full service restoration)

**Kill Criteria:**
- Outage > 4 hours → Activate full manual mode
- Data loss > 0.1% → Immediate rollback to last known good state

---

### IC-02: AgentOS Orchestration Failure

**Description:** AgentOS task routing system fails, leaving OpCos operating in isolation.

**Trigger Conditions:**
- Task queue depth > 10,000
- Worker node failure > 50%
- Scheduler deadlock detected

**Impact Assessment:**
| OpCo | Function Affected | Severity | Recovery Mode |
|------|------------------|----------|---------------|
| Irrig8 | Cross-system alerts | Medium | Local monitoring only |
| VPC | Customer journey | Medium | Standalone mode |
| Zoe | Task intake | High | Direct API access |

**Mitigation:**
1. Local agent autonomy mode
2. Manual escalation paths documented
3. Emergency runbooks
4. Cross-training for human operators

**Recovery Protocol:**
- **Automated:** 30 minutes (queue redistribution)
- **Manual:** 4 hours (full orchestration restoration)

**Kill Criteria:**
- Task loss > 100 → Immediate investigation
- Recovery > 8 hours → Consider architectural redesign

---

### IC-03: Shared Infrastructure Cascade

**Description:** Unified cloud infrastructure failure (AZ outage, cluster failure, networking partition) causes simultaneous outage across ALL OpCos.

**Trigger Conditions:**
- Availability zone outage affecting primary cluster
- Kubernetes cluster failure (control plane)
- Network partition between OpCo workloads

**Impact Assessment:**
| OpCo | Function Affected | Blast Radius |
|------|-------------------|--------------|
| Irrig8 | Field telemetry ingestion | 500+ farms offline |
| VPC | Gaming platform | All users disconnected |
| Zoe | AI reasoning API | All assistants down |
| AgentOS | Task orchestration | All automation stops |

**Mitigation:**
1. Multi-AZ deployment (3+ availability zones)
2. Cluster federation across regions
3. OpCo-local hot standby (15-min RPO)
4. Circuit breakers to graceful degraded mode

**Recovery Protocol:**
- **Automated:** 5 minutes (AZ failover)
- **Manual:** 45 minutes (full restoration)
- **Catastrophic:** 4 hours (regional rebuild)

**Kill Criteria:**
- RTO > 30 minutes → Require local standby mode
- Data loss > 5 min → Implement synchronous replication
- Cost of redundancy > 40% → Reassess unified approach

---

## Data Breach (DB)

### DB-01: Cross-OpCo Data Leakage

**Description:** Shared data lake access control failure exposes OpCo-specific data to unauthorized users.

**Trigger Conditions:**
- Access policy misconfiguration
- Privilege escalation attack
- Insider threat

**Impact Assessment:**
| Data Type | Exposure Risk | Regulatory Impact |
|-----------|--------------|-------------------|
| Irrig8 farm data | High (PII) | CCPA, state privacy laws |
| VPC customer data | Critical (financial) | Gaming regulations |
| AgentOS operational data | Medium | Internal only |

**Mitigation:**
1. Row-level security enforcement
2. Data classification tagging
3. Comprehensive audit logging
4. Zero-trust access model

**Recovery Protocol:**
- **Immediate:** Revoke affected access tokens
- **24 hours:** Forensic analysis complete
- **48 hours:** Remediation and notification

**Kill Criteria:**
- > 1,000 records exposed → Regulatory notification required
- > 10,000 records exposed → Consider data separation

---

### DB-02: Ransomware Attack on Shared Systems

**Description:** Ransomware attack encrypts shared data lake and core infrastructure, simultaneously impacting all OpCos.

**Attack Vectors:**
| Vector | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation Complexity |
|--------|------------|--------|----------------------|
| Phished admin credentials | High | Critical | Medium |
| Supply chain compromise | Medium | Critical | High |
| Unpatched vulnerability | Medium | High | Low |
| Insider threat | Low | Critical | Very High |

**Cascading Impact Timeline:**
| Time | Event | OpCo Affected | Recovery Action |
|------|-------|---------------|-----------------|
| T+0 | Ransomware detonates | All | Activate incident response |
| T+5 min | Data lake encrypted | Irrig8, Zoe, AgentOS | Isolate affected systems |
| T+15 min | Backups detected | All | Verify immutable backup integrity |
| T+1 hr | Ransom demand received | Executive | Engage legal/forensics |
| T+4 hrs | Decision point: pay vs. restore | Leadership | Activate disaster recovery |
| T+24 hrs | Full restore begins (if no payment) | All | Parallel recovery operations |
| T+72 hrs | Service restoration | All | Gradual user access restoration |

**Blast Radius Analysis:**
| OpCo | Critical Data at Risk | Business Impact (72hr outage) | RTO Priority |
|------|----------------------|-------------------------------|--------------|
| Irrig8 | Farm telemetry, prescriptions | $85K (crop risk) | P0 |
| VPC | Player balances, transaction logs | $180K (regulatory) | P0 |
| Zoe | User conversations, agent state | $45K (reputation) | P1 |
| AgentOS | Task queues, agent assignments | $25K (operational) | P1 |
| Trenchbabys | Inventory, POS transactions | $60K (revenue loss) | P1 |
| **Total** | — | **$395K** | — |

**Mitigation Architecture:**
| Layer | Control | Implementation | Cost |
|-------|---------|----------------|------|
| Prevention | MFA, endpoint protection | All admin accounts | $12K/yr |
| Detection | SIEM, behavioral analytics | 24/7 monitoring | $24K/yr |
| Response | Isolated recovery environment | Air-gapped restore | $18K/yr |
| Recovery | Immutable backups (3-2-1) | Geo-redundant, WORM | $36K/yr |

**Kill Criteria:**
- Recovery time > 72 hours → Reassess shared infrastructure model
- Data unrecoverable → Consider OpCo isolation as permanent architecture
- Regulatory fine > $500K → Separate data lakes per OpCo

## Regulatory Block (RB)

### RB-01: Unified Data Regulatory Block

**Description:** Regulator determines cross-OpCo data sharing violates privacy or gaming regulations.

**Trigger Conditions:**
- Regulatory inquiry into data practices
- Competitor complaint
- Customer privacy complaint escalation

**Impact Assessment:**
| Scenario | Operational Impact | Timeline |
|----------|-------------------|----------|
| Consent order | 15% efficiency loss | 6 months |
| Cease and desist | 30% efficiency loss | Immediate |
| Fine + remediation | 10% efficiency loss + $$$ | 12 months |

**Mitigation:**
1. Privacy-preserving architecture from inception
2. Legal entity firewalls between OpCos
3. Data minimization principles
4. Proactive regulatory engagement

**Recovery Protocol:**
- **Immediate:** Compliance with regulatory order
- **6 months:** Architectural separation if required
- **Ongoing:** Enhanced privacy controls

**Kill Criteria:**
- Fine > $10M → Reassess unified data strategy
- Criminal referral → Immediate separation of OpCos

## Usage Guidelines

1. **Before Integration:** Review all IC and DB failure modes
2. **Monthly:** Update failure mode probabilities based on operational data
3. **Quarterly:** Run tabletop exercises for Critical severity failures
4. **Annually:** Comprehensive failure mode library review
