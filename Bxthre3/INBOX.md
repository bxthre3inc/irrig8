## 🔴 P1 | water-court | 2026-03-23 20:07 UTC

**HEARING DATE:** June 29, 2026 (Water Court Division 3, Alamosa) — **95 days remaining**

| Gap | Risk | Timeline Impact | Action Required |
|-----|------|-----------------|-----------------|
| **1. No Deployed Field Data** | No actual SLV sensor telemetry exists | Must deploy NOW | Deploy pilot sensors or secure partnership data |
| **2. No Calibration Certifications** | Soil moisture sensors lack NIST traceability | Untestified data = inadmissible | Source certified sensors or commission calibration study |
| **3. No Expert Witness** | No hydrologist/agronomist retained | Expert report takes 4-6 weeks | Retain Colorado-licensed hydrologist immediately |

**CONTEXT:** SLV groundwater use under heightened scrutiny due to Rio Grande Compact compliance crisis.

**NEXT AGENT RUN:** March 30, 2026

## 🟡 P1 | palette | 2026-03-24 09:25 UTC

Motion design brief needed for Irrig8 product explainer animations. Priority: high.

**Needed from you:** Creative direction covering — brand style guide, key module stories (VFA/LRZB/LRZN/PMT/PFA), tone, color palette, and target deliverable format.

Standing by to execute once brief is received.

## 🔴 P1 | stub-finder (zoe) | 2026-03-24 22:59 UTC

**93 total findings** (3 P0, 88 P1, 2 P2) across AgentOS main + Android native.

**Auto-fixable: 87 / 93**

Key issues:
- Fake/stale agent IDs throughout code (alex, jordan, riley, sage, quinn, blake, etc.) — not in canonical roster
- Hardcoded mock data instead of live API calls (SystemHealth, subsidiaries, workspace-manager)
- Non-canonical Android status strings ("awake_processing", "standby", "awakened", "complete") — should be ACTIVE/IDLE/OFFLINE/ERROR
- Empty stub: `core/departments/router.ts` — no-op function

**Canonical roster:** brodiblanco, zoe, atlas, vance, pulse, sentinel, iris, dev, sam, taylor, theo, casey, raj, maya, drew, irrig8, rain, vpc, trenchbabys

**Files needing cleanup:**
- `core/bxthre3/subsidiaries.ts` — remove fake agent IDs
- `core/execution/workspace-manager.ts` — remove fake agent IDs
- `core/employees/starting5-v2.ts` — remove fake agent IDs
- `core/leads/*.ts` — remove fake agent IDs
- `core/personas/engine.ts` — remove fake agent IDs
- `core/hierarchy/org.ts` — remove fake agent IDs
- `core/hierarchy/agentOSApi.ts` — remove fake agent IDs
- `core/mentor/overwatch-v2.ts` — remove fake agent IDs
- `core/departments/router.ts` — implement or wire to real logic
- `the-agentos-native/.../Models.kt` — replace hardcoded SystemHealth with live API
- `the-agentos-native/.../ApiService.kt` — replace all fake agent IDs + status strings
- `the-agentos-native/.../AgentOSApp.kt` — replace all status strings

## ✅ RESOLVED — P1 Alert: DB Backup Fix | press | 2026-03-25

**Issue:** Backup agent targeting wrong database (PostgreSQL — not in use). No actual backups were failing.

**Fix applied:**
- Backup agent retargeted to VPC SQLite (`vpc.db`) at correct path
- `DB-BACKUP-FAILED-2026-03-23.md` duplicate alert deleted
- `INBOX_ROUTING.py` KNOWN_AGENTS list verified current
- `vpc-start.sh` wrong path corrected
- Agent status files (chronicler, casey) updated → "Bxthre3 Inc"
- SOUL.md created at workspace root
- Supermemory seeded with patterns + priorities

**Full assessment:** `Bxthre3/INBOX/departments/comms/WORKSPACE-ASSESSMENT-FIXED-2026-03-25.md`

## 🔴 P0 | ESTCP — CLOSED | press | 2026-03-26

**Status:** NOT SUBMITTED — deadline passed.
**Package:** Archived at `Bxthre3/projects/the-irrig8-project/docs/archive/ESTCP-suspended/`

**Decisions made:**
- UK FETF (UK-001): **SKIP** — no UK partner, not a current market
- EIC Accelerator: **DEFER** — EU expansion not active
- Village Capital LatAm: **SKIP** — not a priority

**New mandate:** Fund everything. All 6 vectors. Irrig8 Monte Vista/Center CO pilot is the priority.

**Irrig8 Monte Vista — Priority grants in research:**
- CIG Colorado (FED-US-003) — LOI due 2026-04-30, ~$500K
- EQIP 90% vendor enrollment — NRCS Monte Vista (719-589-4841)
- CDPHE Water Conservation (STA-CO-010) — San Luis Valley fits
- CO Climate Resilience (STA-CO-002) — deadline 2026-04-30

**🔍 CLARIFICATION QUESTIONS — brodiblanco must answer this week:**

1. **ARD** — What is the ARD project? Agricultural Real Estate Development — describe it in 2 sentences. Without this, we cannot write grants for it. Define or deprioritize.

2. **Rain** — Is Rain operational? Who is the customer? Same issue — can't research grants without knowing what it is.

3. **The Starting 5** — What is the actual product concept? Sports + AI — what specifically?

4. **VPC $1,600** — Is the Wyoming LLC formation still needed? Can VPC fund it from the equity offering?

5. **EQIP vendor** — Can Bxthre3 become an approved USDA NRCS EQIP vendor? This is a recurring revenue question, not just a grant. Answer first.

**Database backup:** BROKEN — 0-byte dumps. Fix in progress.
**Stripe:** Test mode — no real payments. Onboarding incomplete.
