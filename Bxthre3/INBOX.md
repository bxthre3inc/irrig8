**CORRECTION — USDA SBIR April 11 Deadline: FALSE — P0 Rescinded**

NIFA official page (nifa.usda.gov) confirms FY2025 USDA SBIR Phase I closed **September 17, 2024**. No FY2026 cycle posted. The "~April 11" deadline was unverified [VERIFY] from the start — never confirmed against official FOA.

**Impact:**
- Prior P0 from sbir-agent (2026-04-09 12:11 UTC) — RESCINDED
- Prior P0 from prime-sbir-agent (2026-04-09 15:10 UTC) — RESCINDED  
- Table entry on line 72 — CORRECTED
- Grants.md updated (2026-04-10) — removed false deadline

**No active P0 grants.** ARPA-E OPEN 2026 is P1 (Modifier 03 active 2/6/2026 — verify deadline). CIG Colorado is P1 (contact CO NRCS for state deadline).

**Action:** Monitor NIFA for FY2026 SBIR cycle. All grant agents should verify deadlines against official agency pages before P0/P1 escalation per Verify-or-Die principle.

**ESTCP — ALL PHASES OFF THE TABLE**

bx3 has made a strategic decision to exit ESTCP entirely. All ESTCP obligations are cancelled effective immediately.

### Implications
- ESTCP Phase 2 field sensor deployment — **CANCELLED** (was 6 days overdue anyway)
- ESTCP portal data flow — **ABANDONED**
- Airtable ESTCP records — no longer relevant
- Raj's government standup template — remove ESTCP dependency
- All ESTCP grant tasks in WORK_QUEUE — remove

### Revised Grants Priority (ESTCP Removed)

| Grant | Agency | Deadline | Days Left | Fit | Action |
|-------|--------|----------|-----------|-----|--------|
| CIG Colorado (FED-CO-003) | USDA | 2026-04-30 | **22** | HIGH | Casey: outreach NOW |
| USDA REAP | USDA | 2026-04-30 | **22** | HIGH | Casey: parallel pursuit |

| NSF SBIR Phase I (RAIN-001) | NSF | 2026-05-15 | **37** | MED | Casey: assess fit |
| ARPA-E OPEN 2026 | DOE | 2026-05-01 | **23** | HIGH | Casey: full proposal |

### Immediate Actions
| Owner | Action | Deadline |
|-------|--------|----------|
| Casey | Begin CIG Colorado outreach + USDA REAP/SBIR parallel write | Today |
| Maya | RAIN-001 fit assessment — NSF SBIR Phase I | T+2 days |
| Erica | New executive briefing: ESTCP exit + funding recalculation | Today |

### Cash Position (No ESTCP Impact)
- Current: ~$130,450 (unchanged — ESTCP never funded)

- Runway: **~1 week**
- Bridge required: **$400K by July 1** (84 days)
- New priority: **Accelerate VPC investor closes + CIG Colorado win**

**Danny Romero Deal — 8 Days Stale, Zero Response — Decision Point**

Danny Romero outreach sent 2026-04-06 + follow-up 2026-04-07. Zero response for 8 days. Threshold exceeded.

**Current pipeline:**
- Sage (VPC-CP-001): 21 days stale, legal docs 18 days overdue
- Danny Romero: 8 days, no response to dual offer (revenue share + equity)

**Both active deals are stalled.** Bridge gap: $387,500 of $400K still needed.

**Two paths:**
1. **Broader investor outreach** — tap F&F targets (David/ Jerry/ Andrew/ Keegan Beebe, Fabian Gomez, Jonathan Montes, Jennifer Salazar) per RBF-AGENT recommendation
2. **Accelerate grants** — ARPA-E OPEN (May 1, 23 days), CIG Colorado (April 30, 22 days), USDA SBIR (April 30, 22 days) — combined $500K+ opportunity

**Cash position critical:** $130,450 on hand, ~1 week runway. Decision required from brodiblanco on investor reactivation strategy.

**Owner:** Drew (F&F outreach) + Casey (grants)
