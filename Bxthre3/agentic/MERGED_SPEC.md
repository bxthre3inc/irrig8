# AGENTIC — MERGED SPEC

## IDENTITY

**"Agentic" is the only name.** AgentOS, ABE, AgenticBusinessEmpire, Helm, SymphonyOS (internal), and Live Symphony (research) are all deprecated. Only "Agentic" survives.

## WHAT IS AGENTIC

Agentic is Bxthre3's internal AI operating system. It is not a chatbot wrapper. It is not a dashboard. It is an operating system with:
- A kernel (protected core)
- Agents as processes (workers)
- Enforced correctness (Truth Gate)
- State management (ledger)
- Interrupt/resume (phase gates)
- Self-improvement (Self-Modification Engine)
- Hardware fabric (compute mesh)
- Persistence (reasoning stream)
- Extensibility (orchestration plugins)

**Agentic powers all Bxthre3 verticals:** Irrig8, VPC, RAIN, Build-A-Biz, ARD, Trenchbabys.

## THE THREE NON-NEGOTIABLES

1. ZERO HALLUCINATION — Every claim traces to source. No fetch, no think.
2. DETERMINISM — Same inputs always produce same outputs.
3. GRACEFUL DEGRADATION — No single point of failure.

## BEHAVIORAL PRINCIPLES (from SOUL.md)

1. Be Direct. No Noise.
2. Execute to Completion
3. Canonical Always
4. Ship With Integrity
5. Verify or Die (Zero Hallucination)
6. Evolve or Die (Self-Modification)
7. Communicate With Precision

### Canonical Data Values
- Task status: TODO | IN_PROGRESS | BLOCKED | DONE
- Priority: P0 | P1 | P2 | P3
- Agent status: ACTIVE | IDLE | OFFLINE | ERROR

## 5-LAYER ARCHITECTURE



## ORCHESTRATION ENGINE (5 MODULES — ALL IMPLEMENTED)

| Module | File | Purpose |
|--------|------|---------|
| Reasoning Stream | reasoning_stream.py | Append-only audit |
| Phase Gates | phase_gates.py | Conditional checkpoints |
| Workflow DAG | workflow_dag.py | Learnable DAG templates with IER override |
| IER Router | ier_router.py | Contextual bandits — explainable routing |
| Coherence Engine | coherence_engine.py | Parallel execution layers |

## EVENT-DRIVEN ARCHITECTURE

No rrule. No polling. Pure cascade.

### 4-Tier Cascade


### Event Schema (10-Point Reality Vector)
| Field | Symbol | Description |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| Timestamp | t | Milliseconds since epoch |
| Spatial X | s_x | Longitude or abstract |
| Spatial Y | s_y | Latitude |
| Z-Negative | z_negative | Risk/concern (-100 to 0) |
| Z-Positive | z_positive | Value/opportunity (0 to +10m) |
| Certainty | c | Confidence [0.0–1.0] |
| Logic State | l | DAP decision state |
| Fidelity | v_f | Resolution scale factor |
| Economic | e | Value/cost in USD |
| Governance | g | Compliance status |

### Event Taxonomy


## 9-PLANE DAP (DETERMINISTIC AUTONOMOUS PROTOCOL)

| Plane | Name | Threshold | Type |
|-------|------|-----------|------|
| 1 | Boolean | z_positive < 0.20 | Deterministic |
| 2 | Temporal | time > 24h | Deterministic |
| 3 | Spatial | Kriging coverage > 80% | Deterministic |
| 4 | Geostatistical | variogram model confidence | Deterministic |
| 5 | Hydraulic | percolation > 0.50 | Deterministic |
| 6 | Atmospheric | ET integration complete | Deterministic |
| 7 | Economic | e > 0 (positive ROI) | Bounded |
| 8 | Compliance | governance == COMPLIANT | Deterministic |
| 9 | Strategic | Long-term optimization | Supervised |

Planes 1-6: deterministic. Planes 7-9: bounded uncertainty, human approval for edge cases.

## IRRIG8-SPECIFIC: 4-TIER EAN (SymphonyOS IP)



## AGENT TRIGGER MATRIX

| Agent | Subscriptions | DAP Planes |
|-------|-------------|------------|
| zoe | sfd.*, pmt.*, rss.anomaly.* | [7,8,9] |
| pulse | sfd.agent.*, rss.execution.* | [1,2] |
| iris | pmt.*, dhu.* | [3,4,10,11,12] |
| atlas | sfd.*, rss.* | [5,6,7,8] |
| maya | pmt.market.*, rss.funding.* | [7,9] |
| sentinel | sfd.*, rss.anomaly.* | [1,2,3,4] |

## WU-BASED PRICING MODEL

- BASE_COST: bash.50/WU
- PLATFORM_PREMIUM: bash.20/WU
- Total: bash.70/WU
- Role range: 6-45 WU
- 13 departments, ~90 roles

## DETERMINISM GUARANTEES

| Layer | Input | Output | Guarantee |
|-------|-------|--------|-----------|
| AMP Messages | Binary wire format (76+ bytes) | Same binary format | Byte-exact |
| Tasks | Kotlin data class with JSON schema | Task result with status enum | Type-safe |
| Triggers | Cron OR event type | Cascade actions (1..n) | No orphans |
| Builds | Locked dependency hashes | Binary with SHA256 | Reproducible |

## UTILIZATION TARGET

CPU target: 85%-95%. Minimum: 30%. Never idle.
- CPU < 70% for 3 min → batch burst
- CPU < 50% for 5 min → synthetic task generation
- No active tasks 10 min → Sentinel diagnostic mode

## INTEGRATIONS (connected)

Gmail | Google Calendar | Google Tasks | Google Drive | Notion | Airtable | Linear | Spotify | Dropbox | Supermemory
- Stripe: partial (read only)
- GitHub: NOT CONNECTED
- SMS/SignalWire: API routes exist

| P2: Validation | Proof points / credibility | Patent filed OR metrics captured | Unlock conversations |

| P4: Structural | Equity vs non-equity | Non-dilutive >50% of target | Prioritize grants/RBF |

## LIVE SYMPHONY (RESEARCH)

Research project proving agentic systems can conduct their own research using human as proxy. Not a product — a research layer. Internal middleware, separate LLC planned.

## CANONICAL DIRECTORY STRUCTURE



## NON-NEGOTIABLE RULES

1. Agentic is canonical — never AgentOS, ABE, Helm
2. Irrig8 is canonical — never FarmSense
3. No nested Bxthre3/
4. P0/P1 to Jeremy only — via INBOX.md + SMS
5. Agentic is internal only — trade secret
6. RAG before reporting — always read source files
7. Verify or Die — never fabricate, cite everything

## ZO VS AGENTIC BOUNDARY

**Zo.computer is the hosting layer. Agentic is the management layer.**
- Zo: builds and hosts zo.space routes, runs user services, provides terminal/AI tooling
- Agentic: owns all Bxthre3 strategy, manages workspace structure, configures services

**Never the twain shall cross.**
