# Bxthre3 Document Standards v2.0
**Owner:** brodiblanco | **Maintained by:** AgentOS  
**Effective:** 2026-04-02  
**Reference:** Principle #5 (Zero Hallucination)

# PART I: UNIVERSAL STANDARDS

## AgentOS Positioning — Internal Infrastructure

> **AgentOS is not a product.** It is the internal force multiplier that builds and runs products.  
> **Analogy:** IBM Watson — demonstrated capability, competitive advantage, but NOT a standalone SKU.

### What AgentOS Is
- **Internal AI workforce orchestration** — for Bxthre3 only
- **Enables ventures** — indirect value, not standalone revenue
- **Proprietary moat** — not sold, not licensed, not SaaS

### External Positioning (Clout/Investment ONLY)
**Say:**
> "AgentOS gives us 24/7 execution with 18 AI agents. Internal capability = speed-to-market advantage."

**Never say:**
- ❌ "AgentOS is our next product"
- ❌ "We're building it to sell"
- ❌ "It's a standalone business unit"
