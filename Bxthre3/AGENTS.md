## Architecture & Nesting Protocol

### Nesting Is Forbidden

No `Bxthre3/` inside any project submodule. Projects are peers, not children.

---

## INBOX Routing Rules

```
Any agent creates a report → Bxthre3/INBOX/agents/{agent-name}.md
Escalation P1             → Bxthre3/INBOX.md (→ brodiblanco via SMS)
Department report          → Bxthre3/INBOX/departments/{dept}.md
```
