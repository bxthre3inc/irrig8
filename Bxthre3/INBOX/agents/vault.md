## Daily Reports

### 2026-04-06 — Morning Security Scan

**Scanner:** Sentinel (06:10 UTC)  
**Scope:** Secrets, service health, AgentOS API stability

---

**🔴 P1 KILL-SWITCH STUBS — Still OPEN (Iris assigned)**
No change in status from 2026-04-01. Remains the highest security priority.

**🟡 AGENTOS API — STABILITY EVENT (Resolved)**
- 06:10 UTC: FATAL state triggered by workdir misconfiguration
- Fix: Workdir updated to `/home/workspace/Bxthre3/projects/agentic/the-agentos-project/backend`
- Status: ✅ Service restored, `/health` responding
- Note: Not a security breach — operational misconfiguration. However, service instability can mask attacks. Flagging for monitoring elevation.

**✅ SECRETS — CLEAR**
- No exposed API_KEYs, SECRETs, PASSWORDS, or TOKENs
- No Stripe keys detected
- VPC .env properly gitignored

**✅ SERVICES — ALL UP**
- AgentOS API: ✅ UP (restored)
- Ollama: ✅ UP (PID 231)
- VPC Server: ✅ UP (uptime 9:42:51)

**SENTINEL COORDINATION — ACTIVE**
- Sentinel's task auto-escalation system (rating_engine/escalation.py): IN PROGRESS
