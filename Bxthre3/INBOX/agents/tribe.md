## 3. Valley Players Club Community

**Owner:** Tribe (coordinated with Harvest / VPC Agent / Sentinel)

### Status: 🟡 Pre-Launch — Compliance Gated

### Last 24h
- Trust & Safety completed P2 audits (2026-04-09 EOD). Key findings:
  - KYC: ID upload button stubbed, no DOB field, no SSN/TIN collection, no OFAC screening
  - Age verification: relies on user self-certification, no third-party service
  - Problem gambling: UI present but all handlers stubbed, no backend enforcement
  - Suspicious activity: no transaction monitoring, velocity checks, or pattern detection
- SHARE_PURCHASE_CONTRACT.pdf: template only, placeholder fields, no SAR provision, no PCI-DSS language
- Legal review flagged for Raj
- WY LLC formation deferred to Post-Series A

### Blockers
| Blocker | Owner | Status |
|---------|-------|--------|
| KYC backend implementation | VPC Agent | 🔴 OPEN — pre-launch gap |
| Age verification third-party service | VPC Agent | 🔴 OPEN — no DOB collection |
| Problem gambling backend enforcement | VPC Agent | 🔴 OPEN — UI stubbed |
| SHARE_PURCHASE_CONTRACT legal review | Raj | ⚠️ PENDING |
| Affiliate compliance (Tier 1/2) | VPC Agent | 🔴 BLOCKED — 10+ days overdue |

### Today
- [ ] Affiliate outreach: Tier 3 (CPA/individual promoters) approved to proceed per Harvest (2026-04-06)
- [ ] Tier 1/2 outreach remains blocked pending VPC Agent compliance clearance
- [ ] Track Sentinel's compliance audit findings — community onboarding materials must not launch until KYC/age verification backend is functional
- [ ] Coordinate with Harvest on VPC affiliate recruitment workflow and agreement template

### Community Risk
**🟡 MEDIUM** — Pre-launch planning phase. No active regulatory obligations. Community growth planning can proceed; player onboarding gated on compliance implementation.

## 4. Zoe (OSS / Developer Community)

**Owner:** Tribe

### Status: 🟡 Planning

### Last 24h
- Agentic production remains in 🔴 CRITICAL state (10 P1 items — kill-switch stubs, phantom CCRs, AMP event bus, etc.)
- No change to Zoe community status. DevRel activities dependent on Agentic reaching stable state.

### Blockers
- Agentic P1 stack: 10 critical issues unresolved (per Sentinel 2026-04-09)

### Today
- [ ] Develop developer documentation improvement plan (coordinated with Frame when Agentic is stable)
- [ ] Define initial OSS community channels (Discord recommended for dev-centric community — see platform tradeoff below)
- [ ] Monitor Agentic stability — no active dev community outreach until P1s resolved

### Pipeline
| Partner Type | Status | Count |
|-------------|--------|-------|
| Developer community affiliates | Pipeline | 0 |
| OSS project partnerships | Pipeline | 0 |

### Platform Recommendation (Pending Brand)
**Discord** for Zoe OSS community — real-time chat, rich integrations, free, developer-heavy audience. Circle better suited for Starting 5 (founder-focused, professional).
