### Status Summary

| Area | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Finance Architecture | ✅ Established | FP&A directory structure in place |
| 5-Year Model | 🟡 Skeleton | Framework ready, awaiting actuals |
| Cap Table | 🔴 No data | No equity data found in workspace |
| Series A Dilution Model | 🔴 Not started | No funding round data |
| Venture Models | 🟡 Framework | Irrig8, Starting5, VPC, ZoeCorp frameworks exist |
| Unit Economics | 🟡 Framework | Dashboard framework in fpa/reports/ |
| Key Assumptions | 🟡 Framework | 60% [TBD] fields across all ventures |

### Open Issues

#### 🔴 P1 — No Financial Actuals Available
All financial models are skeleton-only. No actual revenue, cash, or expense data exists in the workspace.

**Blockers:**
- No bank balances (Reserve/treasury has not provided data)
- No Q1 actuals (Accounting has not closed Q1)
- No cap table data (legal documents not in workspace)
- No department budgets (AOP not distributed)

**Owner:** Forecast (VP FP&A)
**Dependencies:** Reserve, Accounting, Legal, Budget

#### 🟡 P2 — 60%+ of Key Assumptions Are [TBD]
Assumption document (fpa/assumptions/KEY_ASSUMPTIONS.md) has extensive [TBD] fields across all ventures:

- All hardware COGS (IRR-C01 through IRR-C09)
- All Starting5 cost metrics (SF5-C01 through SF5-C04)
- All VPC revenue/cost metrics (VPC-001 through VPC-C04)
- All ZoeCorp headcount/revenue metrics (ZOE-001 through ZOE-H03)

**Owner:** Forecast + Model
**Next Action:** Prioritize revenue-generating ventures first (Irrig8, VPC)

## Handoff to Forecast (VP FP&A)

**Model is online. Key items for FP&A sync:**

1. **No financial actuals exist in workspace** — all models are skeleton-only. FP&A function cannot produce real outputs until actuals are provided. What data is available?

2. **Cap table data missing** — No equity documents in workspace. Need Legal to provide cap table or confirm location.

3. **Priority fill order** — Recommend filling Irrig8 assumptions first (hardware ASP/COGS, subscription pricing) since it is revenue-generating and has a near-term Water Court hearing.

4. **Existing financial model assets** — Found extended FarmSense financials HTML at `the-irrig8-project/manual_output/html_pages/page_386_extended-project-financials-and-valuation.html`. May contain useful historical context.

5. **Scenario analysis** — Base/Bull/Bear framework exists in fpa/models/FINANCIAL_MODEL_5YEAR.md. Ready to populate once assumptions are confirmed.

---

## Notes

- FarmSense was retired 2026-03-23 — all financials now under Irrig8 brand
- Zero financial actuals exist in workspace — all models require data population
- FP&A framework is solid; execution blocked on data acquisition
