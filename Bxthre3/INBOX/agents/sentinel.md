**Trust & Safety Daily Standup — 2026-04-06**
- Report filed: `INBOX/departments/trust-safety-standup-2026-04-06.md`
- Distribution: War Room, Anchor (CRO), Counsel (Legal), Atlas (COO)

**Key Findings:**
- Irrig8: Water court gaps UNCHANGED — T-9 days to internal deadline
- VPC: 6 P1s open — gaming tax OVERDUE, CO tax + foreign contractor resolution [VERIFY]
- Agentic: Infrastructure resolved (PostgreSQL restored, API restored); application-layer P1s PERSIST (kill-switch stubs, AMP persistence)
- Security overall: CLEAR — no secrets exposure, no suspicious changes
- Infrastructure risk: DOWN from HIGH to MEDIUM

**No new P1s this cycle requiring INBOX.md escalation.**

**Next standup:** 2026-04-07 8:15 AM MT

**Trust & Safety Daily Standup — 2026-04-07**
- Report filed: `INBOX/departments/trust-safety-standup-2026-04-07.md`
- Distribution: War Room, Anchor (CRO), Counsel (Legal), Atlas (COO)

**Key Findings:**
- Irrig8: Water court DECLARED ABANDONED by Rain (budget constraint) — Risk DOWN to LOW
- VPC: Pre-operational, all regulatory items DEFERRED to Series A — Risk DOWN to MEDIUM
- Agentic: 9 P1s persistent + NEW MCP-mesh deduplication test failure (release-blocking)
- Infrastructure: All services OPERATIONAL (PostgreSQL restored, Agentic API restored)

**NEW P1 this cycle:**
- MCP-mesh deduplication test (`mesh-sync.test.ts:122`) failing — expected=1, received=2
- Routed to INBOX.md as release-blocking per QA protocol

**Risk Posture:** 🟡 MEDIUM (improved from 🔴 CRITICAL — VPC and Irrig8 both de-risked)

**Trust & Safety Daily Standup — 2026-04-09**
- Report filed: `INBOX/departments/trust-safety-standup-2026-04-09.md`
- Distribution: War Room, Anchor (CRO), Counsel (Legal), Atlas (COO)

**Key Findings:**
- Irrig8: 🟢 LOW — Water court abandoned, no active compliance obligations
- VPC: 🟡 MEDIUM — Pre-operational, P2 audits due EOD today (KYC, age verification, problem gambling, suspicious activity)
- Agentic: 🔴 CRITICAL — 10 P1s open (kill-switch stubs 8 days unresolved, MCP-mesh test failure)
- Infrastructure: 🟢 LOW — All services operational

**Risk Posture:** 🟡 MEDIUM overall — Agentic is sole CRITICAL venture. VPC and Irrig8 de-risked.

**Escalations this cycle:**
- P0 SBIR (INBOX.md) — USDA Phase I deadline April 11, 2 days — no T&S implications

**P2 Audits Due 2026-04-09 EOD:**
- KYC end-to-end
- Age verification controls
- Problem gambling safeguards
- Suspicious activity monitoring

**Trust & Safety Daily Standup — 2026-04-15**
- Report filed: `INBOX/departments/trust-safety-standup-2026-04-15.md`
- Distribution: War Room, Anchor (CRO), Counsel (Legal), Atlas (COO)

**Key Findings:**
- Irrig8: 🟢 LOW — water court abandoned, no active compliance obligations
- VPC: 🟡 MEDIUM — pre-operational, 5 audit gaps from 04-09 still open [VERIFY], SHARE_PURCHASE_CONTRACT.pdf legal review still pending
- Agentic: 🔴 CRITICAL — 9 P1s persisting, kill-switch stubs 12+ days unresolved
- Infrastructure: 🟢 LOW — infrastructure risk LOW per last confirmed data
- Sync orchestrator failure 2026-04-14: NO-SHOW T&S standups for 6 days (04-10 through 04-15)

**Data Gap:** Orchestrator failure (2026-04-14) means no verified T&S standup data for 6 days. Items marked [VERIFY] where inference required.

**Risk Posture:** 🟡 MEDIUM overall — Agentic sole CRITICAL venture.

**No new P1s this cycle requiring additional INBOX.md escalation.**
