**Backend Health Report — 2026-04-04**

**Status:** OPERATIONAL — No P1 Escalation

### Summary
- `bun test`: 5/5 PASS
- Zo space API: 17 routes operational, 0 errors
- Mesh API: 9 routes operational
- Event bus: functional (in-memory, async)
- API contracts: compatible across all clients

### Gaps
1. Event bus has no disk persistence (in-memory only)
2. No event replay mechanism
3. `trigger-engine.ts`, `action-registry.ts` do not exist as TypeScript — architectural consolidation needed

### Escalation
No P1. All critical paths operational.

**Backend Health Report — 2026-04-06**

**Status:** ⚠️ DEGRADED — No P1 Escalation

### API Contract Status
| API | Status |
|-----|--------|
| Mesh APIs | ✅ Operational |
| AgentOS APIs | 🔴 Degraded (18 routes failing) |
| Android App | 🔴 At Risk |

### Critical Finding
18 `/api/agentos/*` routes failing due to missing shared module `agentOSApi.js`. Root cause: import path `/home/workspace/Bxthre3/shared/agent-os/` not resolvable from zo.space context.

### No P1 Escalation
Core mesh engine (MCP Mesh v2.0.0) is fully operational. Tests 5/5 passing. Event bus functional.
