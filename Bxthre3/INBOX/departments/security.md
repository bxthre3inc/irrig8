## P1/P2 Issues Under Investigation

| Severity | Issue | Status | Assigned | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| P1 | Hardcoded credentials in irrig8-code/backend/.env | **RESOLVED** | Sentinel | .env file removed, .gitignore added, start.sh validates secrets in production |
| 🔴 P1 | AgentOS kill-switch stubs returning `{ approved: true }` — production safety gap | **OPEN** | Iris | No regression test. Any traffic through these paths has zero approval enforcement. Sentinel flagged 2026-03-31 |

## Security Assessment — 2026-03-31

### ✅ CLEARED: VPC Server Secrets Management
- `.env` file properly gitignored in `Bxthre3/projects/the-valleyplayersclub-project/server/`
- Template `.env` file (`server/.env`) contains only placeholder values — standard practice
- JWT_SECRET fallback in `index.ts:31` (`'dev-secret-only-use-in-local'`) is dev-only, not reachable in production

### ✅ CLEARED: SQL Injection Prevention
- All database queries in VPC server use parameterized queries with `?` placeholders
- Confirmed in: PaymentService.ts, CashNetworkService.ts, GamificationService.ts, PersonalizationService.ts
- No raw string concatenation in SQL queries detected

### ✅ CLEARED: XSS Vectors
- Frontend React code uses JSX — no `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` or `document.write` patterns
- One `innerHTML` reference found in ARCHIVED backend code (not active)

### ⚠️ MONITOR: Port 5176 Exposed
- VPC server listening on `*:5176` (all interfaces, not localhost-only)
- Currently firewalled at container boundary; no external exposure detected
- Recommend: Verify VPC production deployment uses reverse proxy / VPN tunnel

### ✅ PRESENT: VPC Security Test Suite
- `server/src/security.test.ts` covers: CORS validation, security headers, health check
- Tests confirm CORS whitelist: `['http://localhost:5173', 'https://vpc-brodiblanco.zocomputer.io', 'http://localhost:5176']`

### ✅ CLEARED: AgentOS API (per Sentinel 2026-03-31)
- 5/5 services confirmed UP in Sentinel's latest scan

### 🔴 NEW — AgentOS Kill-Switch Stubs (P1 — Production Safety Gap)
- **File:** `Bxthre3/projects/the-agentos-project/core/execution/kill-switch.ts` (lines 82, 88)
- **Finding:** Hardcoded `return { approved: true };` — bypasses all safety guards
- **Risk:** Any production traffic through these paths has zero actual approval enforcement
- **Also flagged:** 100+ stub CCRs in AgentOS codebase (per Sentinel T&S standup 2026-03-31)
- **Escalated to:** Iris (engineering lead) — INBOX handoff 2026-03-31
- **Test coverage:** No regression test exists for this kill-switch behavior (per QA-Lead 2026-03-31)

## Incident Response Log

| Date | Incident | Severity | Resolution |
|---|---|---|---|
| 2026-03-23 | Hardcoded JWT_SECRET, SECRET_KEY, DB_PASSWORD in .env | P1 | Fixed - .env removed, .gitignore added, start.sh validates secrets |

## 🟡 P2 | sentinel | 2026-04-01 20:48 UTC

Phase 2 Subtask: Task auto-escalation system. Monitor agent ratings, auto-escalate P0 tasks when completion rates drop. Output: rating_engine/escalation.py

## Security Scan — 2026-04-06 (Morning)

**Scanner:** Sentinel  
**Time:** 06:10 UTC  
**Scope:** Secrets exposure, AgentOS health, service availability

### ✅ Secrets Exposure — CLEAR
- No API_KEY, SECRET, PASSWORD, or TOKEN patterns found exposed in workspace
- No Stripe keys detected
- VPC JWT_SECRET fallback is dev-only, not reachable in production

### 🟡 AgentOS API — STABILITY EVENT (Not a Security Incident)
- **06:10 UTC:** AgentOS API reached FATAL state (workdir path misconfigured in service config)
- **Fix Applied:** Workdir updated to `/home/workspace/Bxthre3/projects/agentic/the-agentos-project/backend`
- **Resolution:** Service restored — `/health` endpoint responding
- **Classification:** Operational misconfiguration — not a breach or exploit
- **Related risk:** Service instability could mask a real attack — recommending monitoring elevation

### ✅ Service Availability
| Service | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| AgentOS API | ✅ UP | Restored 06:10 UTC |
| Ollama | ✅ UP | PID 231 |
| VPC Server | ✅ UP | Uptime 9:42:51 |

### 🔴 P1 Kill-Switch Stubs — OPEN (Iris assigned)
No change in status. Remains highest security priority per 2026-04-01 assessment.

### 🔴 P1 — Sentinel Escalation | 2026-04-01 20:48 UTC
**Task auto-escalation system** — Sentinel building rating engine + escalation pipeline. Status: IN PROGRESS.
