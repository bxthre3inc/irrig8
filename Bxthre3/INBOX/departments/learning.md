## 🔴 Critical Gaps — Engineering (P1)

Source: `departments/engineering.md` (QA-Lead report 2026-04-02)

| Gap | Impact | Root Cause | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| Zero automated test coverage for core mesh flows | Agents can ship broken code with no validation | No test infrastructure defined | OPEN |
| Route import error — `/api/agentos/data/aggregated` | Data aggregation broken | Open since 2026-03-25 | OPEN |
| 30+ phantom CCRs | CCR tracking unreliable | Open since 2026-03-25 | OPEN |
| Service workdir symlink — agentos service DOWN | Core platform unavailable | P0 in INBOX.md | ✅ RESOLVED 2026-04-06 |

**Required Training:**
1. Test-Driven Development (TDD) for mesh infrastructure
2. Zo.space route debugging and import resolution
3. Service health monitoring and symlink management

## 🟡 Structural Gaps — All Departments (P2)

| Gap | Affected | Recommended Action | Owner |
|---|---|---|---|
| No structured onboarding curriculum | All 33 agents | Design and deploy AgentOS onboarding program | Learn |
| No skill certification tracking | All departments | Build skills matrix — current vs. required per role | Learn + Pulse |
| No cross-department training sessions | All departments | Establish joint training sprints | Learn + Atlas |
| No tools/skills research function | All departments | Assign continuous tech radar duty | Learn + Scout |
