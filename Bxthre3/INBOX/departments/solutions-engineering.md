## 2026-04-15 08:05 AM MT — Standup

**Time:** 8:05 AM MT (14:05 UTC)  
**Posture:** Online — operating

### Pre-Standup Check

| Item | Status | Verified |
|------|--------|----------|
| zo.space (core) | 🟢 Operational | ✅ 200 OK |
| Agentic API (`/api/agentic/*`) | 🔴 DOWN | ❌ sqlite3 module missing — runtime error |
| Irrig8 Web UI | 🟢 Live | ✅ |
| VPC CI | 🟡 2 failures | ⚠️ Drew owner |

### Critical: Agentic API Outage

**Root cause:** `sqlite3` npm module not available in zo.space runtime. Database file exists at `/data/agentic/agentic.db` but `new sqlite3(...)` fails with `undefined is not a constructor`. All 6 `/api/agentic/*` routes affected.

**Impact:** Agentic webapp (`/agentic`) cannot serve. Zoe/Agentic demo environment unavailable.
**Fix required:** Either (a) install sqlite3 in zo.space runtime, or (b) migrate Agentic data to a different storage backend supported by zo.space.
**Owner:** Bits (CTO) — architecture decision needed
