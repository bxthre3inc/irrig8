## 🔴 P1 — ESTCP Phase 2 — DEADLINE MISSED (2026-04-01)

**Original Task:** Deploy ESTCP Phase 2 field sensors (Airtable recGaj5XN2ftpOJ10, zones: LRZ1/LRZ2)  
**Deadline:** 2026-04-01 | **Status:** ❌ MISSED

### What We Know

| Item | Status | Source |
|------|--------|--------|
| Task assigned to | dev | Airtable recGaj5XN2ftpOJ10 |
| Target zones | LRZ1/LRZ2 | Airtable + Field Data table |
| Dev INBOX — ESTCP activity | **ZERO** | dev.md (last 5 entries: AgentOS only) |
| Sensor deployment completed | **UNKNOWN — no evidence** | — |
| Data flowing to ESTCP portal | **UNKNOWN — no evidence** | — |
| Airtable record updated | **NOT UPDATED** | recGaj5XN2ftpOJ10 still TODO |

### Dev Activity During ESTCP Window

| Date | dev INBOX Entries |
|-------|------------------|
| 2026-04-01 18:05 | P0: 2 production services DOWN (mcp-mesh-control-plane, aos) |
| 2026-04-01 19:42 | P3: Android/Desktop tests passing |
| 2026-04-01 20:43 | P2: Phase 1 AMP Auth complete |

| 2026-04-02 | P0 escalation from iris re: AgentOS API broken |

**Dev was entirely consumed by AgentOS production P0s during the ESTCP window. No ESTCP work was logged.**

### iris — System Integration Status

iris INBOX shows **no ESTCP data pipeline activity**. Engineering lead focused on AgentOS P0 API failures (import errors in `get_space_errors()`, aos service DOWN).

### Impact Assessment

| Item | Assessment |
|------|------------|
| Federal grant compliance | ⚠️ AT RISK — deadline miss without documentation |
| DoD relationship | ⚠️ AT RISK — missed deliverable without excuse |
| Next steps | **brodiblanco must confirm** whether deployment happened offline or if formal extension is needed |

### Required Actions

- [ ] **brodiblanco** — Immediate: Was ESTCP sensor deployment completed offline (physically in field) without logging?
- [ ] **dev** — Confirm: Are ESTCP sensors physically deployed in LRZ1/LRZ2 (even if not logged in system)?
- [ ] **dev** — Confirm: Is sensor data flowing to ESTCP portal (even if delayed)?
- [ ] **iris** — ESTCP data pipeline status: is there an integration path for ESTCP sensor data?
- [ ] **raj** — If deployment did NOT happen: assess federal grant implications and whether a formal extension/request can be filed
- [ ] **government** — If deadline formally missed: prepare DoD ESTCP point-of-contact outreach strategy
