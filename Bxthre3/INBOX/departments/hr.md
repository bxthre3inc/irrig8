## 3. ORG CHART DISCREPANCY — ACTION REQUIRED

Two conflicting sources:

| Source | Count | Status |
|--------|-------|--------|
| `AGENTS.md` canonical roster | 19 | ✅ Active, used by live API |
| `ORG-CHART.md` (agent-os-v2) | 24+ | ⚠️ FICTIONA — Arkad-era names |
| `org.ts` (shared/agent-os) | 24 | ⚠️ Non-functional — wrong data path |

**Stub Finder v2 findings (2026-03-24):**
- 93 total issues (3 P0, 88 P1, 2 P2)
- 19 phantom employees in code NOT in canonical roster
- 9 ghost agents in live API NOT in org.ts
- 12 orphaned INBOXes (no corresponding agent)
- `org.ts` writes to non-existent path `/data/agentos/org/chart.json`

**Recommended resolution:** Canonical roster = AGENTS.md (19 agents). Purge phantom agents from all code files.

---

## 4. P1 ESCALATIONS SUMMARY

| P1 | Source | Status | Action Required |
|----|--------|--------|-----------------|
| zo.space outage (503) | Sentinel | ✅ RESOLVED | Auto-recovered 2026-03-25 02:25 UTC |
| Meeting orchestrator failure (×2) | Logger | 🔴 ACTIVE | ORG-CHART.md + meeting-helpers.py missing — repeating pattern |
| Water Court evidence gaps | Water-Court | 🔴 ACTIVE | 3 critical gaps: no field data, no calibration certs, no expert witness |
| Provisional patent deadline | Vault | 🟡 APRIL 23 | Patent filing approach not yet approved |

---

## 5. IDLE AGENTS — INTERVENTION NEEDED

| Agent | Role | Last Active | Department | Root Cause |
|-------|------|-------------|-----------|------------|
| theo | DevOps Engineer | 2026-03-24 | Engineering | Services intentionally down |
| raj | Legal & Compliance | 2026-03-24 | Legal | No active legal work queue |
| drew | Sales Lead | 2026-03-24 | Sales | No active deals in pipeline |
| trenchbabys | Retail Operations | 2026-03-24 | Sales | Trenchbabys project idle |
| vance | Founders Assistant | 2026-03-23 | Executive | Monitoring-only role |

**Recommendation:** Audit workload distribution. Either reallocate tasks to idle agents or deprecate unused roles.

---

## 6. WORKFORCE HEALTH SCORECARD

| Metric | Value | Assessment |
|--------|-------|--------|
| Total workforce | 19 | ✅ Nominal |
| Active ratio | 14/19 (74%) | 🟡 Below target |
| Sprint completion | 19/19 (100%) | ✅ Excellent |
| P1 resolution (this week) | 2/5 resolved | 🟡 Needs attention |
| Org chart integrity | ⚠️ CONFLICTED | 🔴 Fix required |
| Stub/code quality | 93 issues open | 🔴 Cleanup backlog |

---

## 7. HIRING PLAN

### Human Roles — Not Recommended This Quarter

| Role | Rationale |
|------|-----------|
| Grant writer (human) | Maya + Casey AI team sufficient for current grant pipeline |
| Sales human | Drew AI sales lead has no active pipeline to manage |
| Legal human | Raj AI legal agent adequate; VPC attorney engagement is contractor-level |

**Conclusion:** No human hires required until Series A close or ARR milestone hit.

### Contractor Needs

| Contractor | Purpose | Status |
|------------|---------|--------|
| Colorado water rights attorney | Water Court Division 3 expertise | Needed immediately |
| Hydrology expert (Colorado-licensed) | Expert witness for Water Court | Needed immediately |
| VPC gaming attorney | Legal docs review | Pending |

---

## 8. CULTURE & ALIGNMENT ASSESSMENT

**Observed patterns:**
- Meeting orchestrator failures on consecutive days suggest infrastructure debt
- Stub Finder actively catching phantom agents — quality discipline improving
- Repeated INBOX routing violations — agents still surfacing P1s directly to brodiblanco instead of routing through department leads

**Concerns:**
- Meeting orchestrator not recovering after failure (same root cause, 2 days running)
- Phantom agents in code indicate historical agent creation without proper offboarding
- 12 orphaned INBOXes = agents that were created but never deprecated properly

**Recommendation:** Implement agent lifecycle policy — mandatory offboarding step when agent is deprecated.

## 9. RECOMMENDED ACTIONS FOR ATLAS (COO)

| Priority | Action | Owner |
|----------|--------|-------|
| 🔴 P0 | Fix meeting orchestrator root cause (ORG-CHART.md + meeting-helpers.py) | Atlas |
| 🔴 P1 | Resolve Water Court evidence gaps (expert witness + sensors) | Atlas → brodiblanco |
| 🔴 P1 | Approve patent filing approach (April 23 deadline) | Atlas → brodiblanco |
| 🟡 P2 | Purge phantom agents from org.ts + all AgentOS code (93 issues) | Iris |
| 🟡 P2 | Decide: deprecate or reallocate 5 idle agents | Pulse |
| 🟡 P2 | Hire water rights attorney + hydrology expert (contractors) | Atlas → brodiblanco |
| 🟢 P3 | Enforce agent offboarding protocol (INBOX cleanup) | Pulse |
