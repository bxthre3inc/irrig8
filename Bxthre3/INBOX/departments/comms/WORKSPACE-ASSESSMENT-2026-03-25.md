## Detailed Breakdown

### 1. 🌍 zo.space Active Routes — 3/10 🔴

**73 routes deployed.** Six are serving **default zo.space boilerplate** — no real content:
- `/ard` — placeholder
- `/govcon` — placeholder
- `/sportsedge` — placeholder
- `/talent` — placeholder
- `/projects/android-native-ide` — placeholder
- `/projects/adm-standard` — placeholder

**Impact:** Every dead route is a broken promise to a visitor. These pages exist in navigation/search but deliver nothing.

**Also:** `/ard/details`, `/ard/details/sign` suggest a deal-management flow with unclear status.

**Action:** Build or delete. No middle ground.

---

### 2. 🤖 AgentOS Code Quality — 4/10 🔴

- **`ApiService.kt`** — 100% mock data. No real HTTP calls. Every `fetch*()` function returns hardcoded `listOf(...)`. This is the source of the phantom agent detections.
- **`LocalDataSource.kt`** — All agent data is `LocalAgent` models with no server sync.
- **Android native build** — Has Gradle/tooling churn history. Last active 2026-03-24 per profile, current state unverified.
- **Capacitor builds** — VPC and AgentOS mobile apps were rebuilt successfully but are flagged as "not real clients" by brodiblanco.
- **`/api/grants`** endpoint returns empty/mismatched data per recent session notes.
- **No real API integration** — all network layers are stubs.

**Action:** Prioritize ApiService.kt real endpoint wiring. That single file unlocks the entire mobile stack.

---

### 3. 🎰 VPC Platform Readiness — 5/10 🟡

- **`/invest` and `/investor-deck`** routes exist and render correctly.
- **Share math** was corrected in recent sessions (500,001 / 499,999 split).
- **Private 2.5% terms** correctly hidden from public pages.
- **Universal investor portal** (`/investor-portal`) with phone verification flow built.
- **Missing:** `/api/tasks` endpoint was noted as missing in last session. Grants data on `/api/grants` is empty/mismatched.
- **QR code + one-pager** distribution workflow not yet tested end-to-end.

**Action:** Wire `/api/tasks`, fix `/api/grants`, then run full investor flow test with real device.

---

### 4. 📬 INBOX System Integrity — 5/10 🟡

- Three-layer routing script (`INBOX_ROUTING.py`) exists at `Bxthre3/INBOX/agents/`.
- **11 agent inboxes** present (casey, drew, iris, maya, raj, sam, sentinel, taylor, theo, zoe, + sentinel).
- **DB-BACKUP-FAILED-2026-03-25.md** — active P1 alert in INBOX root. Backup failed last night and needs resolution before next cycle.
- **DB-BACKUP-FAILED-2026-03-23.md** — same failure pattern 2 days prior. This is a recurring failure, not a one-off.
- **No DB backup succeeded since at least 2026-03-23.**
- Department inboxes present but content quality unknown.

**Action:** Fix the database backup agent. This is a data integrity risk.

---

### 5. 🌐 Zo Space Home + Branding — 7/10 🟢

- `brodiblanco.zo.space` is live and functional.
- VPC investor pages and Irrig8 pages render correctly.
- Branding is consistent where pages are built.
- **Gap:** Home page (`/`) and overall nav structure not reviewed in this session.

---

### 6. 📁 Project Structure & Hygiene — 7/10 🟢

- All active projects correctly live under `/home/workspace/Bxthre3/projects/`.
- **Stale projects** still sitting in `Bxthre3/` root (not in projects/):
  - `the-age-of-reason/` — appears abandoned
  - `the-rain-project/` — deployed to `/projects/rain` but source still at root
  - `the-valleyplayersclub-project/` — in root, should be in projects/
- **Nested Bxthre3** — no instances found in project subdirectories (rule is being followed).
- **Archive hygiene** — FarmSense materials were archived on 2026-03-24 per IP canonicalization work. Some cleanup of old artifacts may still be needed.

**Action:** Move the 3 stale projects into `projects/` and clean up root.

---

### 7. 💰 Grants Pipeline — 7/10 🟢

- `GRANT_FIRST_STRATEGY.md` exists in Irrig8 IP folder.
- `grants-hq` skill exists and is installed.
- `grants-prospector` skill exists.
- Grant search/infrastructure is functional.
- **Gap:** Active grant applications, deadlines, and status not tracked in a visible pipeline view.

---

### 8. 🛠 Skills Infrastructure — 7/10 🟢

- `meeting-orchestrator`, `rain-gemini`, `zo-linkedin`, `zo-twitter` skills present.
- Skills follow the `Skills/<skill-dir>/SKILL.md` spec correctly.
- GitOps manager skill present.
- **Gap:** No skill health checks or usage metrics. Some skills may be untested since install.

---

### 9. 🚰 Irrig8 IP & Strategy — 6/10 🟡

- FarmSense → Irrig8 rebrand completed 2026-03-23.
- IP folder archived correctly.
- Grant-first strategy documented.
- **Gap:** No confirmed active patent filing. No IP roadmap visible outside of the grant strategy doc. FarmSense-era code still sitting in `farmsense-code/` directory — may need review for transferable assets.
- The Irrig8 product itself (satellites + sensors + deterministic farming OS) is not yet reflected in a live product page.

---

### 10. 📋 Documentation & Memory — 3/10 🔴

- `AGENTS.md` exists at workspace root.
- **PROJECT_MANIFEST.md** exists in `Bxthre3/` and is the single source of truth for what exists.
- **Major gap:** `SOUL.md` is missing from the workspace. No behavioral identity file found for the agent system.
- No `AGENTS.md` found inside individual project directories (they are recommended for project-specific context).
- Sprint logs (`EV-*`, `ON-*`) exist but are not indexed or summarized anywhere.
- `Supermemory/` folder is **empty** — no structured memory files present.

**Action:** Create `SOUL.md`. Add `AGENTS.md` to key project directories. Index sprint logs.

---

### 11. 🔄 GitOps & Backup — 6/10 🟡

- Git sync logs present (`git-sync-upgrade.log`, `service-restarts.log`).
- `db-20260318-*` backups exist — last successful backup was **2026-03-18**.
- **Backup has been failing for 7+ days** (DB-BACKUP-FAILED logs from 03-23 and 03-25).
- Backup agent is registered and running on schedule, but is failing silently or with unhandled errors.
- No off-site or redundant backup verification.

**Action:** Fix the backup agent. This is the highest-priority operational risk.

---

### 12. 🧠 Supermemory (Knowledge Mgmt) — 2/10 🔴

- `/home/workspace/Supermemory/` directory **exists but is completely empty**.
- No structured memory files, no indexed learnings, no personA profiles saved here.
- **Personality and activity profiles exist** (generated from conversation history) but are not written to Supermemory as persistent documents.
- Agent briefing system (`Bxthre3/agents/briefings/`) has one file from 2026-03-23 but no subsequent updates.

**Action:** Populate Supermemory with key learnings. This is a long-term velocity multiplier.
