# WORKSPACE ASSESSMENT — CORRECTED VERSION
**Date:** 2026-03-25 | **Evaluator:** Press
**Original Score:** 5.1 / 10 | **Revised Score:** 6.0 / 10

> **Assessment errors found and corrected during remediation:**
> - 5 of 6 "placeholder" routes were FULLY BUILT pages (govcon, sportsedge, talent, android-native-ide, adm-standard)
> - All 3 "stale" projects were already inside `projects/` (the-age-of-reason, the-rain-project, the-valleyplayersclub-project)
> - Backup agent issue is SQLite, not PostgreSQL (the agent was targeting a non-existent PostgreSQL instance)

## Notes for Next Assessment Cycle

1. **Before flagging "stale projects"** — verify they don't already exist in `projects/`
2. **Before flagging "placeholder routes"** — fetch and inspect the actual route code
3. **Backup issues** — check what database is actually in use before assuming PostgreSQL
4. **SOUL.md** — should be created at workspace root on first assessment; add to assessment checklist
