## 2026-03-30 — Weekly Workspace Cleanup Audit

**Status:** Issues Found

---

### Issue 1: Truncated Artifact at Workspace Root
- **Severity:** LOW
- **Path:** `Bxthre3/projec`
- **Description:** A truncated directory/file fragment at workspace root. Likely an incomplete name (possibly `Bxthre3/projects` or `Bxthre3/projects/...` interrupted during creation).
- **Recommended Action:** Inspect and consolidate. If it contains any uncommitted work product, merge into the correct `Bxthre3/projects/` subdirectory. If it is empty or junk, delete it.

---

### Issue 2: Malformed Git Submodule Entry
- **Severity:** HIGH
- **Path:** `Trash/credswallet-temp`
- **Description:** `git submodule status` returned `fatal: no submodule mapping found in .gitmodules for path 'Trash/credswallet-temp'`. This indicates `Trash/credswallet-temp` was registered as a submodule in `.git/modules` but has no corresponding entry in `.gitmodules`. This is a broken submodule reference.
- **Recommended Action:** Run `git submodule deinit Trash/credswallet-temp` then `git rm Trash/credswallet-temp` to cleanly remove the broken submodule mapping. Then `rm -rf Trash/credswallet-temp` if the directory still exists in Trash.

---

### Issue 3: Large Untracked Agent Inbox Proliferation
- **Severity:** LOW
- **Paths:** `Bxthre3/INBOX/agents/` (many untracked `.md` files including `ambient-capture.md`, `archivist.md`, `cartographer.md`, `grader.md`, `irrigation-*.md`, `keeper.md`, `operations.md`, `pulse-health-*.md`, `slv-sensor.md`)
- **Description:** 20+ untracked agent inbox files. Many appear to be irrigation-specific agents (`irrigation-arid`, `irrigation-coastal`, `irrigation-framework`, `irrigation-greenhouse`, `irrigation-grid`, `irrigation-temperate`, `irrigation-tropical`, `irrigation-vertical`). These may be orphaned or newly created agents not yet committed.
- **Recommended Action:** Review each untracked agent inbox. Commit legitimate agents to version control. Delete any that are stale or superseded.

---

### Issue 4: Untracked Project and Directory Proliferation
- **Severity:** LOW
- **Paths:** `Backups/`, `Bxthre3/RESEARCH/`, `Bxthre3/SECURITY.md`, `Bxthre3/ThinkTank/`, `Bxthre3/VAULT/drafts/`, `Bxthre3/plans/`, `Bxthre3/routes/`, `Bxthre3/www/`, `Skills/`, `Bxthre3/grants-tasks-20260329.md`, `Bxthre3/grant-tasks.json`, `Bxthre3/projec` (also flagged in Issue 1)
- **Description:** Numerous top-level and `Bxthre3/` untracked directories/files. Some may be intentional (e.g., `RESEARCH`, `ThinkTank`, `VAULT`) but exist outside the canonical `Bxthre3/projects/` structure.
- **Recommended Action:** Audit each directory — move any project-related content under `Bxthre3/projects/`. Confirm `Backups/`, `RESEARCH/`, `ThinkTank/`, `routes/`, `www/` are intentional and properly located.

---

### Issue 5: Uncommitted Changes — Standard INBOX/Agent Activity
- **Severity:** LOW (workflow)
- **Description:** ~90+ modified (`M`) and untracked (`??`) files across the workspace — mostly INBOX updates, agent reports, meeting logs, and sprint documents. This is expected ongoing work not yet committed.
- **Recommended Action:** No immediate action required. Routine commit discipline will clear these. Prioritize committing any completed, verifiable work before starting new tasks.

---

### Submodule Status (No Issues)
All 5 submodules are properly initialized and at expected commits:
- `Bxthre3/projects/mcp-mesh` — `6f5904e` (heads/main)
- `Bxthre3/projects/the-agentos-project` — `510ab73` (v0.9.2-4)
- `Bxthre3/projects/the-irrig8-project` — `7c8ff68` (remotes/origin/HEAD)
- `Bxthre3/projects/the-rain-project` — `98a531c` (heads/main)
- `Bxthre3/projects/the-valleyplayersclub-project` — `4f16172` (remotes/origin/HEAD)

---

### Trash Status
Trash directory is empty — no cleanup needed.

---

### Nested Bxthre3 Directories
No nested `Bxthre3` directories found under `Bxthre3/projects/`.

---

**Summary:** 1 HIGH severity issue (broken submodule `Trash/credswallet-temp`), 4 LOW severity issues. Recommend resolving the broken submodule first, then consolidating truncated/fragment artifacts.

---

## 2026-04-06 — Weekly Workspace Cleanup Audit

**Status:** Issues Found

---

### Issue 1: Orphaned Submodule Reference (Broken)
- **Severity:** HIGH
- **Path:** `Bxthre3/ARCHIVE/mcp-mesh_20260330`
- **Description:** `git submodule status` returns `fatal: no submodule mapping found in .gitmodules for path 'Bxthre3/ARCHIVE/mcp-mesh_20260330'`. An entry exists in `.git/modules` but not in `.gitmodules` — likely a partial cleanup of a deleted submodule.
- **Recommended Action:** Run `git submodule deinit Bxthre3/ARCHIVE/mcp-mesh_20260330 2>/dev/null; git rm --cached Bxthre3/ARCHIVE/mcp-mesh_20260330 2>/dev/null; rm -rf .git/modules/Bxthre3/ARCHIVE/mcp-mesh_20260330 2>/dev/null` to cleanly remove the orphaned reference. Then commit.

---

### Issue 2: Uncommitted Submodule Changes — the-irrig8-project
- **Severity:** HIGH
- **Path:** `Bxthre3/projects/the-irrig8-project`
- **Description:** Submodule has 5 modified uncommitted files in `simulation/runs/slv-sensor-correlation/` — correlation reports, summaries, and CSV data files.
- **Recommended Action:** Commit inside the submodule first, then update parent reference. Do not leave uncommitted simulation output in submodules.

---

### Issue 3: Uncommitted Submodule Changes — the-agentos-project
- **Severity:** HIGH
- **Path:** `Bxthre3/projects/the-agentos-project`
- **Description:** Submodule shows modified `.gitmodules`, `AmbientCapture-LOG.md`, `AGENTS.md`, and a deleted `ARCHIVE/mcp-mesh_20260330`. Cross-linked submodule state is dirty.
- **Recommended Action:** Commit inside the-agentos-project first. The cross-linked `.gitmodules` modification suggests the parent repo and this submodule share git history — investigate before forcing any resets.

---

### Issue 4: Uncommitted Submodule Changes — the-valleyplayersclub-project
- **Severity:** HIGH
- **Path:** `Bxthre3/projects/the-valleyplayersclub-project`
- **Description:** Submodule has 5 deleted Gradle lock/checkpoint files in `android-native/.gradle/8.4/`.
- **Recommended Action:** Commit the deletions inside the submodule to clean up the Gradle state.

---

### Issue 5: Orphaned Submodule Registrations — Missing Project Dirs
- **Severity:** LOW
- **Paths:** `Bxthre3/projects/the-zoe-project`, `Bxthre3/projects/the-ard-project`
- **Description:** Both are registered in `.gitmodules` and `.git/config` as submodules but the directories do not exist on disk.
- **Recommended Action:** If these projects are active, clone them. If retired, run `git submodule deinit <path>` and `git rm --cached <path>` to remove the registration cleanly.

---

### Issue 6: Truncated Directory Fragments at Workspace Root
- **Severity:** LOW
- **Paths:** `Bxthre3/projects/ard-pro`, `Bxthre3/projects/ard-project/`, `Bxthre3/projects/flee`, `Bxthre3/projects/the`, `Bxthre3/projects/the-ag`, `Bxthre3/projects/the-agentos-pro`, `Bxthre3/projects/the-rain-pro`, `Bxthre3/projects/the-start`, `Bxthre3/projects/the-trench`, `Bxthre3/projects/trenchbabys-project/`, `Bxthre3/projects/valley`, `Bxthre3/projects/zo-computer-android/`, `Bxthre3/projects/zo-space-android/`, `Bxthre3/projects/zoe-seo/`
- **Description:** Many truncated or oddly-named project directory fragments at workspace root level and inside `Bxthre3/projects/`. These suggest interrupted copy/move operations or partial project creation.
- **Recommended Action:** Inspect each — consolidate anything with valid content into `Bxthre3/projects/<canonical-name>/`. Delete anything that is empty or junk. These should not exist as sibling fragments.

---

### Issue 7: Large Volume of Uncommitted Workspace Changes
- **Severity:** LOW (workflow)
- **Description:** 90+ files modified (`M`) and 200+ files untracked (`??`) across the workspace — INBOX updates, agent reports, meeting logs, daily standups, telemetry reports, ThinkTank documents, and project artifacts.
- **Recommended Action:** Routine commit discipline. Prioritize committing completed verifiable work. The sheer volume suggests agents are writing to INBOX faster than commits are happening — consider a daily auto-commit cadence for stable INBOX content.

---

### Trash Status
Trash directory is empty — no cleanup needed.

---

### Truncated Artifact Scan (Workspace Root)
No truncated artifact files matching `*Bxthr*`, `*AP_*`, or `*ATION_*` patterns found at workspace root. ✅

---

### Nested Bxthre3 Directories
No nested `Bxthre3` directories found under `Bxthre3/projects/`. ✅

---

**Summary:** 4 HIGH severity issues (1 broken submodule reference + 3 submodules with uncommitted changes), 3 LOW severity issues. Immediate action: resolve the orphaned submodule reference and commit inside each dirty submodule. Secondary action: audit and consolidate truncated project directory fragments.
