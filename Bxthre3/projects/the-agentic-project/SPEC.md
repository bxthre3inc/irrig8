## 1. Product Overview

**AgentOS** (also known as Agentic) is an AI workforce orchestration platform built on the BX3 Universal Architecture. Every agent, every task, every execution is a bounded BX3 Loop. No agent can propose and execute. No agent can act without a human accountability anchor. Every action is on the Ledger.

**Who it's for:** Businesses that need AI workforces they can trust with high-stakes operations. Regulated industries, critical infrastructure, financial operations, legal, healthcare.

**Why it's different:** Every competitor in AI workforce orchestration has agents that reason and act on the same plane. AgentOS enforces the BX3 three-property separation as the runtime architecture — not a policy.

**Current state:** 70+ production routes deployed across /api/agentic/* including workforce management, DAP evaluation, forensic tracing, FTE synthesis, voice command, LinkedIn integration, OTA updates, and Android task management.

## 1b. The Chairman Paradigm

AgentOS operates as a **recursive intelligence mesh** with a single Root Authority.

- **The Chairman** (brodiblanco) sits at the apex — the single decision authority
- **Orchestrators** (Zoe, Atlas, Vance) decompose intent and route tasks
- **Workers** execute atomic tasks and return verifiable outputs

**The Trust Invariant:** Every summary provided to the Chairman must be trace-linked back to the raw Leaf-Node data that generated it. This is not a guideline — it is architecturally enforced by the FTE.

**Abstraction Leakage** is the core problem the Chairman Paradigm solves: when a human "logs in" to a sub-node (conventional systems), they lose global context and the audit trail fractures. AgentOS solves this via **Root Tunneling** (Pillar 4) — the Chairman projects authority into any node without collapsing the hierarchy. The node structure is tunneled, not flattened.

## 2. The BX3 Loop as Runtime Architecture

```
PURPOSE ────► BOUNDS ENGINE ────► FACT LAYER
  ("Why")         ("How")             ("Action")
     ▲               ▲                   ▲
  Human          Limbless            Deterministic
  Anchor         Proposer            Physical Firewall
```

### Purpose Layer (Owner Interface)

**Actor:** Human owner or designated Human Accountability Anchor.

**What it does:**
- Sets strategic goals for the agent
- Defines authorization boundaries (what this agent is NOT permitted to do)
- Establishes escalation thresholds (when to throw to the Bailout Protocol)
- Reviews the Ledger for accountability

**Product feature:** Owner Dashboard (web + mobile) — goal-setting, Ledger view, exception monitoring, authorization boundary config.

**Constraint:** Purpose layer MUST remain Human-anchored. Architecturally enforced at the Fact Layer.

### Bounds Engine (Agent Reasoning)

**Actor:** Zo — the heuristic reasoning engine that powers AgentOS agents.

**What it does:**
- Task decomposition, planning, prioritization, risk assessment
- Models outcomes in Sandbox before proposing
- Generates proposals — never executes
- Operates in a sandboxed cognitive environment with no physical execution permissions

**Product feature:** Agent Reasoning Interface — proposal explanations, simulation results, confidence scores, bounds display.

**Constraint:** Limbless. Cannot directly commit acts to external systems without passing through the Fact Layer.

### Fact Layer (AgentOS Executor)

**Actor:** The AgentOS execution engine — deterministic gate between proposal and action.

**What it does:**
- Receives proposals from Bounds Engine
- Validates against: (a) owner's authorization boundaries, (b) hard-coded safety constraints, (c) regulatory rules
- Executes ONLY approved actions
- Logs every event to the Ledger with SHA-256 forensic sealing
- Triggers Bailout Protocol if condition falls outside provisioned bounds

**Product feature:** Execution Firewall — action log, blocked actions with reasons, complete forensic audit trail.

**Constraint:** 100% deterministic. If a proposal violates a constraint, it is blocked. Only override is from Purpose Layer (human owner).

## 3. The Five Pillars as Product Features

### Pillar 1: Loop Isolation — Task Isolation Mode

Every task an agent performs is a self-contained BX3 sub-loop. The agent's Bounds Engine works inside the task. The Fact Layer gates task outputs. The Purpose Layer provides task context.

**Product behavior:**
- Tasks cannot share state without going through the Fact Layer
- A compromised Bounds Engine in one task cannot bleed into another task's execution
- Task outputs are gated by the Fact Layer before being passed to the next task
- Agents that call other agents must route through the Fact Layer — no direct agent-to-agent execution

### Pillar 2: Recursive Spawning — Child Agents

A parent agent births a child agent by provisioning a **Worksheet** — a containerized, self-contained logic set tailored to a specific context.

**Product behavior:**
- Parent provisions a child agent Worksheet via OTA delivery
- Child has its own BX3 loop with hard-coded pointer to parent's Purpose
- Child operates independently during cloud disconnection (Local Survivability)
- Child's telemetry and execution logs route to parent's Ledger view

**Child Agent properties:**
- Inherits parent's Purpose boundaries
- Has independent Bounds Engine and Fact Layer
- Can be revoked at any time by parent or human owner

### Pillar 3: Spatial Firewall — Tiered Data Access

AgentOS enforces data access through capability tiers. Different tiers get access to different data planes.

| Tier | Label | Data Access | Execution Permissions |
|------|-------|-------------|----------------------|
| Tier 1 | Observer | Aggregated summaries only | Read-only |
| Tier 2 | Analyst | Time-series data, reports | Generate insights, no external calls |
| Tier 3 | Operator | Full data plane, integrations | Execute within authorization boundaries |
| Tier 4 | Admin | All planes, all integrations | Execute with HITL approval for high-stakes |

### Pillar 4: Root Tunneling — Owner Override

The human owner can project their Purpose into any agent or task without disrupting the hierarchy. This is NOT a "login" — it is a dedicated I/O pipe.

**Sandbox Gate (Pre-Execution Simulation):**
- Zo models projected outcome in digital twin environment
- Owner reviews the projected outcome
- Explicit HITL approval required before Fact Layer unlocks execution

### Pillar 5: Bailout Protocol — Exception Escalation

If an agent's Bounds Engine encounters a condition it cannot resolve, it fires a **Bailout Trigger** — an async signal that propagates up the agent hierarchy, bypassing all Machine actors, until it reaches a Human Accountability Anchor.

**Three Trigger Conditions:**
1. **Capability Boundary** — Task falls outside agent's provisioned capability
2. **Safety Envelope Violation** — Sandbox shows proposed action would violate safety constraints
3. **Authorization Gap** — Decision implications exceed agent's authorization authority

**Trigger Lifecycle:**
```
TRIGGER_FIRED → ESCALATING_TO_PARENT → PARENT_EVALUATING
    → [Parent can resolve] → RESOLVED → logged to Ledger
    → [Parent cannot resolve] → ESCALATING_TO_ROOT → HUMAN_REVIEWING
    → Human issues directive → DIRECTIVE_EXECUTING → CLOSED
```

**The Ledger:** Every event logged across three simultaneous planes:

| Plane | What it Records |
|-------|----------------|
| Purpose | What the owner authorized |
| Bounds Engine | What the AI proposed and why |
| Fact Layer | What actually executed and the physical outcome |

SHA-256 sealed per event. Cannot be altered retroactively.

## 4. The 9-Plane DAP as Operational State Model

AgentOS implements the 9-Plane Data Action Protocol as defined in the BX3 Universal Architecture. Every event is decomposed into 9 discrete, orthogonal planes.

```
              | Purpose       | Bounds Engine   | Fact
--------------|---------------|-----------------|--------------
Past          | P1: Mandate   | P4: Reason Log  | P7: Outcome Rec
Present       | P2: Intent    | P5: Decision    | P8: Execution
Future-Pred   | P3: Plan      | P6: Projection  | P9: Projection Conf
```

**Plane Isolation Rule:** No plane can write to any other plane. Architecturally enforced.

**Tamper-Evident Ledger:** All 9 planes linked through a cryptographically chained log. Any retrospective modification breaks the chain and is detectable in O(1) verification time.
