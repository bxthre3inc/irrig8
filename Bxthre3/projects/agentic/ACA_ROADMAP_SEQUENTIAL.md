---

## TRACK 1: PROOF-OF-CONCEPT IMPLEMENTATION

### Phase 1: Foundation (Days 1-2)
**Sequential Step 1.1:** Implement core ACAEvent interface
- Input: Current zo.space event routes
- Process: Extend Reality Vector with thermodynamic + metabolic fields
- Output: TypeScript interface with all 6 revolutionary features
- Verification: Compile without errors, validate against JSON schema

**Sequential Step 1.2:** Build thermodynamic budget calculator
- Input: Event payload size, cascade depth, DAP plane count
- Process: Calculate Landauer bound + estimated execution energy
- Output: thermodynamics field populated on every event
- Verification: Events with budget exceeded return 429 (rate limit)

**Sequential Step 1.3:** Integrate with existing DAP evaluator
- Input: Current 9-Plane DAP from /api/agentic/dap/evaluate
- Process: Add Planes 10-12 (Thermodynamic, Metabolic, Consensus)
- Output: 12-Plane DAP with physical constraints
- Verification: Test event that passes 1-9 but fails 10 (energy budget)

**Decision Gate 1:** Does 12-Plane DAP correctly block over-budget events?
- YES → Proceed to Phase 2
- NO → Debug thermodynamic calculator, revisit Step 1.2

### Phase 2: Antifragile Engine (Days 3-4)
**Sequential Step 2.1:** Build stress capital tracker
- Input: Event cascade history from persistence store
- Process: Count near-misses (DAP planes 1-6 passed by < 10% margin)
- Output: antifragility.stress_capital incremented per near-miss
- Verification: 3 near-misses on Plane 5 → stress_capital = 3.0

**Sequential Step 2.2:** Implement schema mutation on failure
- Input: Event that failed DAP (not thermodynamic block)
- Process: Evolve threshold: new_threshold = old × (1 - 0.1 × stress_capital)
- Output: Spawn "speciation event" with mutated schema
- Verification: Failed moisture threshold 20% → evolves to 18% after stress

**Sequential Step 2.3:** Chaos injection scheduler
- Input: System idle periods (low metabolic rate)
- Process: Deliberately inject 5% of events with slightly wrong vectors
- Output: Measure system response, log antifragility gain
- Verification: Post-chaos, successful events show higher stress_capital

**Decision Gate 2:** Does mutation improve success rate on retry?
- YES → Proceed to Phase 3
- NO → Adjust mutation algorithm (adaptive vs fixed threshold change)

### Phase 3: Reality Consensus (Days 5-6)
**Sequential Step 3.1:** Multi-agent vote aggregation
- Input: 3+ sensor readings for same (s_x, s_y, t) coordinates
- Process: Byzantine consensus algorithm (2/3 agreement required)
- Output: consensus.current_votes populated, divergence flagged
- Verification: 2 sensors say moisture 15%, 1 says 35% → escalate to human

**Sequential Step 3.2:** Agent reputation weighting
- Input: Historical vote accuracy per agent/sensor
- Process: Weight votes by historical precision, decay old data
- Output: consensus.byzantine_threshold dynamically adjusted
- Verification: Accurate sensor gets 0.6 weight, new sensor gets 0.2

**Sequential Step 3.3:** Speculative execution on disagreement
- Input: Split vote (2 say irrigate, 1 says don't)
- Process: Spawn 2 mini-cascades (A: irrigate, B: don't), simulate 1 hour
- Output: Compare simulation outcomes, pick higher expected value
- Verification: Simulate both, measure actual vs predicted outcomes

**Decision Gate 3:** Does consensus reduce false positive irrigation?
- YES → Proceed to Phase 4
- NO → Adjust Byzantine threshold or add more sensors

### Phase 4: Metabolic & Causal (Days 7-8)
**Sequential Step 4.1:** Circadian phase calculator
- Input: Event timestamp, farm GPS coordinates
- Process: Calculate local solar time, plant metabolic phase
- Output: metabolism.circadian_phase (0-24), night/day mode
- Verification: 2 AM events show circadian_phase ~2, batch mode active

**Sequential Step 4.2:** Causal chain logging
- Input: Every event emission (parent → child relationships)
- Process: Store full ancestry, root hypothesis, intervention points
- Output: causality.chain queryable by correlation_id
- Verification: Trace /api/agentic/forensic/trace returns full causal tree

**Sequential Step 4.3:** Counterfactual simulator
- Input: Completed event cascade with actual outcomes
- Process: Replay with 1 parameter changed (e.g., moisture threshold 15% vs 20%)
- Output: causality.counterfactuals array with alternative histories
- Verification: "If threshold was 15%, we would have irrigated 2 hours earlier"

**Decision Gate 4:** Can we answer "why did we irrigate at 3 AM?" with causal chain?
- YES → Proceed to Integration
- NO → Debug ancestry logging, check parent-child linking

### Phase 5: Integration & A/B Test (Days 9-10)
**Sequential Step 5.1:** Deploy ACA alongside legacy AgentOS
- Input: Running Irrig8 production system
- Process: Shadow mode — ACA evaluates, legacy executes, compare decisions
- Output: Decision divergence log (ACA said X, legacy did Y)
- Verification: < 5% divergence on routine events, divergence logged for review

**Sequential Step 5.2:** Measure antifragility metrics
- Input: 1 week of shadow operation data
- Process: Calculate stress_capital accumulation, mutation success rate
- Output: antifragile_coefficient trend (should increase over time)
- Verification: Coefficient increases with each near-miss survived

**Sequential Step 5.3:** Selective activation on low-risk scenarios
- Input: High-confidence events (all planes pass by > 20% margin)
- Process: Let ACA execute, legacy shadows
- Output: Real production validation with safety fallback
- Verification: ACA executes 20% of events, 0 escalations to legacy

**Final Verification:** 30-day shadow period complete, antifragility proven?
- YES → Full ACA deployment authorized
- NO → Extend shadow, debug specific failure modes
