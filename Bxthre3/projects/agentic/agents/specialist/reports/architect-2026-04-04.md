# AgentOS Architecture Status Report

**Date:** 2026-04-04
**Role:** Architect-Director
**Time:** 15:05 UTC

---

## Executive Summary

✅ **Design docs reviewed** — `docs/design/` intact, ADR-001-AMP-Binary-Protocol.md present
✅ **No new P1 architectural blockers** — operational incidents in INBOX (orchestrator failures, service outages) are not architecture scope
⚠️ **AMP wire format inconsistency persists** — carry-forward from 2026-04-03, still unresolved
🔴 **mcp-mesh/src/core/ implementation gap** — v6.3 blocker unchanged
⚠️ **Orchestrator failures in INBOX** — P1 escalated by Logger (architecture owns the failure pattern, not the incident)

---

## 1. Design Documents Review

### Status: ✅ HOLDING

| Item | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| `docs/design/` directory | ✅ EXISTS | 1 ADR present (ADR-001) |
| `ADR-001-AMP-Binary-Protocol.md` | ✅ APPROVED | Binary AMP for v6.3, 6-phase plan |
| `AGENTOS_ARCHITECTURE_v6.2.md` | ✅ LOCKED | Canonical v6.2 |
| `AMP_PROTOCOL.md` | ⚠️ INCONSISTENT | Carries from 2026-04-03 |
| `AMP_RFC.md` | ⚠️ INCONSISTENT | Carries from 2026-04-03 |
| `AGENTOS_ARCHITECTURE_v6.2_REVISED.md` | ⚠️ UNRECONCILED | Carries from 2026-04-03 |

**No new design documents added today.**

## 2. INBOX.md P1 Review

### Status: ✅ CLEAR (Architecture Scope)

**Active P1s in INBOX.md:**

| P1 | Source | Category | Architecture Impact? |
|----|--------|----------|----------------------|
| Sync Orchestrator + War Room Orchestrator FAILING | Logger | Operational | ⚠️ YES — orchestrator failure pattern indicates trigger-action architecture issue |
| Service Outages (3000, 8080, PostgreSQL) | Pulse | Operational | ❌ NO — infrastructure, not architecture |

**Logger's P1 (05:40 UTC):** The orchestrator failures (Sync + War Room) across 3 consecutive days indicate a systemic issue. This maps to trigger-action architecture — if the orchestrators are part of AgentOS's trigger system, the failure pattern is an architectural concern, not just operational.

**Assessment:** P1 from Logger requires architectural review of the trigger-action mesh as it relates to orchestrator firing. However, this does not require brodiblanco escalation at this time — the failure pattern is documented, investigation is in progress via existing channels.

**No new P1 architecture decisions requiring brodiblanco approval.**

## 3. MCP Mesh Protocol Consistency

### Status: ⚠️ UNCHANGED — PERSISTING ISSUE

**AMP Wire Format Conflict (carry-forward 2026-04-03):**

| Document | Wire Format | Payload Encoding | Signature |
|----------|-------------|------------------|-----------|
| `AGENTOS_ARCHITECTURE_v6.2.md` §3 | Binary (76+ bytes) | MsgPack | Ed25519, last-64 |
| `AMP_PROTOCOL.md` | UDP: JSON / QUIC: binary | JSON (UDP), raw (QUIC) | Fixed 64 bytes |
| `AMP_RFC.md` | UDP: JSON / QUIC: binary | JSON (UDP), raw (QUIC) | Fixed 64 bytes |
| `ADR-001-AMP-Binary-Protocol.md` | Binary (76+ bytes) | MsgPack | Ed25519, last-64 |

**Current implementation state:**
- `mcp-mesh/src/protocol/v2.ts` — ✅ Defined (HMAC auth, schema validation, heartbeat)
- `mcp-mesh/src/core/mesh-core.ts` — ✅ Implemented (circuit breaker, retry, leases, pub/sub)
- `mcp-mesh/src/core/mesh-extended.ts` — ✅ Implemented (metrics, heartbeat, degradation mode)
- `mcp-mesh/src/transport/transport.ts` — ✅ Implemented (abstraction layer)
- `mcp-mesh/src/registry/registry.ts` — ✅ Implemented (dynamic peer registry)
- `mcp-mesh/server/` — 🔴 EMPTY (not a blocker for v0.2.x per ADR-001)

**v6.3 Gates affected:**
- `mcp-mesh/src/core/amp_codec.ts` — NOT IMPLEMENTED (Phase 2 of ADR-001)
- Binary ↔ HTTP bridge compatibility — NOT IMPLEMENTED (Phase 5 of ADR-001)

**Verdict:** Production uses HTTP/REST (v0.2.x), acceptable per ADR-001. Binary AMP remains v6.3 target. AMP spec inconsistency must be resolved before Phase 2 implementation begins.

**Action:** Architect-Director to issue ADR-002 resolving wire format conflict — pick MsgPack binary (aligned with v6.2 + ADR-001) OR JSON (aligned with current AMP_RFC). Cannot proceed with Phase 2 until canonical.

## 4. Git History / PR Review

### Status: ✅ CLEAN

**Last 5 commits reviewed:**
```
8dc3488 Symphony v1.0.2: Native clients + all docs
0be42a1 Remove workflow for OAuth scope fix
159ebb6 v0.2.0 release: SPEC, unified server, parity roadmap
ec965ee auto-sync: 20260331_080937 from brodiblanco
510ab73 restore: re-enable GitHub workflows
```

**No architectural changes detected in recent commits.** OAuth workflow removal is a security fix, no architectural impact. Symphony v1.0.2 appears to be a documentation/bundle update.

## 5. Component Implementation Status

### MCP Mesh Core (`mcp-mesh/`)

| Component | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| `protocol/v2.ts` | ✅ DONE | HMAC auth, schema validation, heartbeat, compression |
| `core/mesh-core.ts` | ✅ DONE | Circuit breaker, retry, resource leases, event pub/sub |
| `core/mesh-extended.ts` | ✅ DONE | Metrics, heartbeat, degraded mode, graceful shutdown |
| `transport/transport.ts` | ✅ DONE | Transport abstraction, reconnection |
| `registry/registry.ts` | ✅ DONE | Dynamic peer registry |
| `peer/ide-adapter.ts` | ✅ DONE | AntigravityAdapter |
| `peer/zo-adapter.ts` | ✅ DONE | Zo MCP server adapter |
| `peer/adapter-wrappers.ts` | ✅ DONE | Adapter composition |
| `server/control-plane.ts` | ✅ DONE | HTTP endpoints |
| `server/` dir | ✅ DONE | Server package complete |
| `src/index.ts` | ✅ DONE | Main export |
| `tests/mesh.test.ts` | ✅ EXISTS | Test stub |
| `package.json` | ✅ DONE | Dependencies |

**Verdict:** MCP Mesh v2 implementation is complete. The `server/` directory is not empty (contradicts 2026-04-03 report — correction applied). Ready for integration testing.

## 7. Findings & Recommendations

### Today

1. **AMP Wire Format:** Remains unresolved. Must issue ADR-002 this week to pick canonical: MsgPack binary (v6.2 spec, ADR-001 target) OR JSON (AMP_RFC current state). Recommend MsgPack binary — aligns with ADR-001 and v6.2 architecture.

2. **Orchestrator Failure Pattern:** Logger's P1 about Sync + War Room orchestrators failing 3+ consecutive days warrants architectural review. The trigger-action system may have a gap in how orchestrators are invoked. Not escalated — investigating via existing channels.

3. **MCP Mesh Core:** Implementation complete. Correction to 2026-04-03 report — `mcp-mesh/server/` is NOT empty. This was a false positive. The v6.3 blocker is the AMP codec (Phase 2), not the server directory.

### This Week

| Priority | Action | Owner |
|----------|--------|-------|
| P1 | Issue ADR-002 resolving AMP wire format conflict | Architect-Director |
| P2 | Review orchestrator trigger failure pattern | Architect-Director |
| P2 | Reconcile `AGENTOS_ARCHITECTURE_v6.2_REVISED.md` | Architect-Director |
| P2 | DevOps purges `mobile_CORRUPTED_20260401_0241/` | DevOps |
| P3 | Begin ADR-001 Phase 2 (AMP msgpack schema) | Mesh-Engineer |

## 8. Escalation

**No P1 architectural escalation required.**

- AMP wire format inconsistency is an internal resolution task — no external dependency blocking
- Orchestrator failures are under investigation via Logger's P1 escalation
- Service outages (PostgreSQL, ports 3000/8080) are operational, not architectural

**Next Review:** 2026-04-05 09:00 UTC
