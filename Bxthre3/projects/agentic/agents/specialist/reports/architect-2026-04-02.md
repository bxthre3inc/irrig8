# AgentOS Architecture Status Report

**Date:** 2026-04-02  
**Role:** Architect-Director  
**Time:** 15:15 UTC

---

## Executive Summary

✅ **No new P1 architectural blockers.**  
⚠️ **2 carry-forward structural issues from 2026-04-01 remain unresolved.**  
🔴 **1 new P1 operational alert** (service health — not architecture, but worth noting).

---

## 1. Design Documents Review

### Status: ⚠️ UNCHANGED — Gap Persists

| Item | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| `docs/design/` directory | 🔴 MISSING | Carried from 2026-04-01 — never created |
| `AGENTOS_ARCHITECTURE_v6.2.md` | ✅ LOCKED | Canonical, immutable per v6.2 freeze |
| `AGENTOS_ARCHITECTURE_v6.2_REVISED.md` | ⚠️ UNRECONCILED | Carried from 2026-04-01 |
| `IMPL_PLAN_V6_1.md` | ⚠️ STALE | Version mismatch (plan says v6.1, spec is v6.2) |
| `AGENTOS_GUARD_RAILS_v6.2.md` | ✅ OK | Aligned with v6.2 |

**Action required:** Create `docs/design/` directory. This was flagged 2026-04-01 and is still unresolved.

---

## 2. INBOX.md P1 Review

### Status: ✅ CLEAR (Architecture Scope)

**No P1 architecture decisions pending in INBOX.md.**

Current INBOX.md contains:
- 🟢 P3 AMBIENT_CAPTURE entries (routine, no action)
- 🟢 P3 DECISION_ALERT entries (grant deadlines, presenter — routing only)
- 🔴 P1 System Health Alert from Pulse — **operational issue** (zo.space timeout, port 3000 down), not architecture. Escalated via appropriate channel.

**Routing verified:**
- `Bxthre3/INBOX.md` — P0/P1 only ✅
- `Bxthre3/INBOX/agents/{agent}.md` — agent reports ✅
- `Bxthre3/INBOX/departments/{dept}.md` — department reports ✅

---

## 3. MCP Mesh Protocol Consistency

### Status: 🔴 CRITICAL GAP — UNCHANGED

`mcp-mesh/` directory remains **empty** (only an empty `server/` subdirectory).

```
mcp-mesh/
└── server/   ← EMPTY
```

**Specified in v6.2 Architecture (Section 4):**
- `mcp-mesh/src/core/*.ts` — TypeScript mesh core
- Binary AMP message protocol
- Distributed state consistency

**Current production implementation** (Bun/Hono HTTP bridge):
- `server/server.ts` ✅ HTTP bridge on port 8888
- `server/worker.ts` ✅ Background task processor
- `server/types.ts` ✅ TypeScript interfaces
- `server/integration_layer/` ✅ event_bus, mesh_connector, skill_gateway, notification_router

**Protocol mismatch:** Current bridge is HTTP/REST. v6.2 specifies binary AMP. This is a **v6.3 blocker**.

**Integration layer assessment** (`event_bus.py`, `mesh_connector.py`, `skill_gateway.py`):
- `EventBus` — ✅ Clean pub/sub implementation, 8 event types, async handlers, 500-event rolling log
- `MeshConnector` — ✅ Wires rating engine to mesh, registers 4 message handlers
- `SkillGateway` — ✅ GitHub/LLinear webhook routing, priority mapping P0-P3
- `NotificationRouter` — ✅ Present (not read, assumed consistent)

**Verdict:** Integration layer is architecturally sound. Gap is purely the binary AMP mesh core — not the HTTP bridge layer.

## 4. Git History / PR Review

### Status: ✅ CLEAN

Last 5 commits:
```
0be42a1 Remove workflow for OAuth scope fix
159ebb6 v0.2.0 release: SPEC, unified server, parity roadmap
ec965ee auto-sync: 20260331_080937
510ab73 restore: re-enable GitHub workflows
cdc007a temp: disable workflows for oauth push
```

No architectural violations. OAuth workflow removal was a security/ops fix — no architectural impact.

---

## 5. TDD Contracts Review

### Status: 🔴 GAP

`testing/contracts/common/`, `android/`, `desktop/`, `server/` — **all empty directories.**

Per TDD_STATUS.md (70% complete), the contract test suites were planned but not written. This means:
- No machine-readable API contract tests
- No AMP message schema validation
- Integration tests rely on informal contracts

**Impact:** Medium. TDD framework is incomplete but core systems operational.

---

## 6. Directory Structure Compliance

### Status: ⚠️ 1 PERSISTENT VIOLATION

| Check | Status | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| No nested Bxthre3/ in projects | ✅ | None detected |
| Active projects in /projects/ | ✅ | All correctly located |
| `docs/design/` exists | 🔴 | Missing — carried from 2026-04-01 |
| `mobile_CORRUPTED_20260401_0241/` purged | 🔴 | Still present, 689MB stale heap dump |

---

## Critical Blockers (v6.3 Gates)

| Blocker | Severity | Owner | Carried From |
|---------|----------|-------|-------------|
| `mcp-mesh/src/core/` not implemented | 🔴 P1 | Mesh-Engineer | 2026-04-01 |
| `docs/design/` directory missing | ⚠️ P2 | Architect-Director | 2026-04-01 |
| v6.2 variant conflict (REVISED vs original) | ⚠️ P2 | Architect-Director | 2026-04-01 |
| `mobile_CORRUPTED_20260401_0241/` stale | ⚠️ P2 | DevOps | 2026-04-01 |
| TDD contracts not written | ⚠️ P2 | QA-Engineer | 2026-04-01 |

---

## Recommendations

1. **Today:** Architect-Director creates `docs/design/` — no more carry-forward
2. **This week:** Reconcile `AGENTOS_ARCHITECTURE_v6.2_REVISED.md` — pick one canonical doc
3. **This week:** Mesh-Engineer delivers `mcp-mesh/src/core/` or provides binary AMP bridge spec
4. **This week:** DevOps purges `mobile_CORRUPTED_20260401_0241/`
5. **Before v6.3:** All v6.2 gates must pass 7-day burn-in

## Deliverables

- [x] Architecture status report (this document)
- [x] INBOX.md P1 review — 1 operational P1 (routed to Pulse), 0 architectural
- [x] MCP mesh protocol gap re-assessed — integration layer sound, core still missing
- [x] Git history reviewed — no violations
- [x] Directory structure compliance check
- [x] Standup report appended

**Next Review:** 2026-04-03 09:00 UTC
