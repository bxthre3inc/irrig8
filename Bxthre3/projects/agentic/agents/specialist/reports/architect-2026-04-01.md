# AgentOS Architecture Status Report

**Date:** 2026-04-01  
**Role:** Architect-Director  
**Time:** 15:05 UTC

---

## Executive Summary

✅ **No P1 blockers found.**  
⚠️ **3 critical structural issues identified** — all block v6.3 progression.

---

## 1. Design Documents Review

### Status: ⚠️ PARTIAL

- `docs/design/` directory **does not exist** — needs to be created
- Existing architecture docs in project root:
  - `AGENTOS_ARCHITECTURE_v6.2.md` ✅ (canonical, locked)
  - `AGENTOS_ARCHITECTURE_v6.2_REVISED.md` ⚠️ (divergent variant — needs reconciliation)
  - `AGENTOS_GUARD_RAILS_v6.2.md` ✅
  - `ENGINEERING_ROADMAP.md` ✅
  - `IMPL_PLAN_V6_1.md` ⚠️ (version mismatch — spec says v6.2, plan says v6.1)
  - `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` (duplicate content, should redirect to root doc)

### Issues

| Issue | Severity | Action Required |
|-------|----------|----------------|
| `docs/design/` missing | P2 | Create directory + populate with ADRs |
| v6.2 vs v6.2_REVISED conflict | P2 | Reconcile or archive one variant |
| `IMPL_PLAN_V6_1.md` stale | P2 | Update to v6.2 or deprecate |

---

## 2. INBOX.md P1 Review

### Status: ✅ CLEAR

No P1 architecture decisions pending. Current INBOX.md contains only P3 AMBIENT_CAPTURE entries.

**Routing confirmed:**
- P0/P1 escalations → `Bxthre3/INBOX.md` ✅
- Agent reports → `Bxthre3/INBOX/agents/{agent}.md` ✅
- Department reports → `Bxthre3/INBOX/departments/{dept}.md` ✅

---

## 3. MCP Mesh Protocol Consistency

### Status: 🔴 CRITICAL GAP

The `mcp-mesh/` directory exists but is **empty** (only `server/` subdirectory with no content). The MCP mesh core implementation is **not present**.

```
mcp-mesh/
└── server/   ← EMPTY (no .ts, no .py, no source files)
```

**This is a v6.3 blocker.** The architecture doc (Section 4) specifies:
- `mcp-mesh/src/core/*.ts` — referenced in architect-director.md
- Binary AMP message protocol
- Distributed state consistency

**Current bridge implementation** (mcp-bridge/):
- `server.ts` ✅ — Bun/Hono HTTP bridge on port 8888
- `worker.ts` ✅ — Background task processor
- `types.ts` ✅ — TypeScript interfaces
- Version: 3.0.0 with phases [1,2,3,5]

**Gap:** mcp-bridge is HTTP/REST, not the binary AMP mesh specified in v6.2 architecture.

---

## 4. Mobile Directory Status

### Status: ✅ HEALTHY

- `mobile/` — Active Android project (FOXXD APK: `AgentOS-FOXXD-v0.1.0.apk`, 8.6MB)
- `mobile_CORRUPTED_20260401_0241/` — Corruption detected 2026-04-01 02:41 UTC
  - Contains stale `.hprof` heap dump (689MB) from 2026-03-29
  - **Recommend:** Purge this directory before it causes confusion

---

## 5. Git History Review (Last 20 Commits)

### Status: ✅ CLEAN

Last 5 commits:
- `ec965ee` auto-sync 2026-03-31 ✅
- `510ab73` restore GitHub workflows ✅
- `cdc007a` temp disable OAuth push ✅
- `b5a0dfa` cleanup archived native app ✅
- `dc2f3a2` remove redundant docs ✅

No architectural violations detected in recent commits.

---

## 6. Directory Structure Compliance

### Status: ⚠️ VIOLATIONS FOUND

| Check | Status | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| No nested Bxthre3/ in projects | ✅ | None detected |
| Active projects in /projects/ | ✅ | All 8 projects correctly located |
| Corrupted directories cleaned | 🔴 | `mobile_CORRUPTED_20260401_0241` persists |
| docs/design/ exists | 🔴 | Missing — needs creation |

---

## Critical Blockers (v6.3 Gates)

| Blocker | Severity | Owner |
|---------|----------|-------|
| `mcp-mesh/src/core/` not implemented | 🔴 P1 | Mesh-Engineer |
| `docs/design/` directory missing | ⚠️ P2 | Architect-Director |
| v6.2 variant conflict | ⚠️ P2 | Architect-Director |

---

## Recommendations

1. **Immediately:** Create `docs/design/` with ADR-001 (AMP binary protocol adoption)
2. **This week:** Reconcile `AGENTOS_ARCHITECTURE_v6.2_REVISED.md` vs original
3. **This week:** Mesh-Engineer delivers `mcp-mesh/src/core/` implementation
4. **This week:** Purge `mobile_CORRUPTED_20260401_0241/`
5. **Before v6.3:** All v6.2 gates must pass 7-day burn-in
