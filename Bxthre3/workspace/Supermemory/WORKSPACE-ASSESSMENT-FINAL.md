## 🏗️ PROJECTS (7 active) — Score: 7/10

| Project | Health | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `the-irrig8-project` | 6/10 | Brand contamination (Irrig8), massive legacy code, 71 files referencing Irrig8 |
| `the-valleyplayersclub-project` | 7/10 | Working backend+services, investor portal live |
| `the-agentos-project` | 6/10 | Multiple APK versions, MCP server, API shape issues fixed |
| `the-agentos-native` | 5/10 | Duplicate project, 3 APK files, build clutter |
| `the-rain-project` | 5/10 | RAIN product page deployed, outreach docs in progress |
| `mcp-mesh` | 7/10 | Clean, documented, A/B comparison planned |
| `slv-mesh` | 4/10 | Minimal, nodes.csv + assets, underutilized |

**Issues:**
- `the-agentos-native` is a duplicate of `the-agentos-project` android source — same code, two locations
- `farmsense-code/` in `the-irrig8-project` is old/dead code (Irrig8 branding, not Irrig8)
- `slv-mesh` has no active development path
- 23 `node_modules` directories across projects (bloat)

**Improvements:**
- Consolidate `the-agentos-native` into `the-agentos-project`
- Archive `farmsense-code/` under `the-irrig8-project/IP/`
- Create A/B comparison tables for `mcp-mesh` vs potential `antigravity-mcp`

## 🛠️ SKILLS — Score: 4/10

**Two separate Skills directories — fragmentation:**

| Location | Skills | Status |
|---|---|---|
| `Bxthre3/workspace/Skills/` | grants-hq, grants-prospector, meeting-orchestrator, rain-gemini, zo-linkedin | Active ✅ |
| `the-irrig8-project/Skills/` | dap, devops-hardening, documentation-integrity, engineering-analysis, service-integration | Orphaned ⚠️ |

**Issues:**
- Skills split across 2 locations — no single source of truth
- `the-irrig8-project/Skills/` has 5 skills that may reference Irrig8
- No `/home/workspace/Skills` (workspace root) — correct location per spec
- `zo-linkedin` skill exists but LinkedIn is not connected in integrations

**Improvements:**
- Move Irrig8 project skills to `Bxthre3/workspace/Skills/` if still needed
- Audit `the-irrig8-project/Skills/` for Irrig8 references before migrating
- Connect LinkedIn integration if `zo-linkedin` skill is to be used

## 🤖 AGENTS (75+ scheduled) — Score: 3/10

**Critical mass problem:** 75+ agents for 7 projects = organizational dysfunction.

### Top-tier (working, relevant)
| Agent | Score | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Casey (Grants) | 8/10 | SMS delivery, active pipeline management |
| Grader (Blue Ocean QC) | 7/10 | Active grading deck, daily output |
| Blueprint (Blue Ocean) | 7/10 | Software hunting active, good cadence |
| Chronicler | 7/10 | Daily digest, good memory maintenance |
| Sentinel | 7/10 | Security monitoring active |
| Pulse | 7/10 | System health active |
| Database Backup | 6/10 | SQLite fixed, running on schedule |
| Rain-Research | 7/10 | SMS delivery, regulatory arbitrage |
| AgentOS Runner | 6/10 | 5-min scheduler running |
| War Room | 6/10 | Daily round table active |
| Sync Agent (Daily Standup) | 6/10 | 24-department standup active |

### Mid-tier (active but underperforming)
| Agent | Score | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Iris (IP Surveillance) | 5/10 | Last ran 2026-03-21 |
| Water Court | 5/10 | Long-horizon, low urgency currently |
| Grader | 5/10 | Feed-forward from Blueprint, mostly reactive |
| GitOps Status | 5/10 | Runs every 2 days, results unclear |

### Ghost Agents (defined but inactive/unused)
| Agent | Score | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **ALL Engineering Dept agents** | 2/10 | 18 agents (Current, Spark, Ground, Flux, Blueprint, Frame, Canvas, Mold, Pixel, Vector, Palette, Scout-QA, Stack, Vault, Scout, Tinker, Trace, Architect) — weekly schedules, no evidence of output |
| **ALL Finance Division agents** | 2/10 | 16 agents (Ledger, Balance, Oracle, Reach, Network, Pipeline, Pitch, Forecast, Budget, Model, Reserve, Claim, Recon, Split, Velocity, Fund) — no deliverables seen |
| **ALL BD/Corp Dev agents** | 2/10 | Nexus, Bridge, Warden, Director, Sage, Lucky, Verity, Cipher, Fund, etc. |
| **Sales agents** | 2/10 | Deal, Prospect, Source, Grow, Insight, Roadmap — defined but no CRM/pipeline integration visible |
| **Marketing agents** | 2/10 | Brand, Rank, Harvest, Optimize, Stage, Tribe, Reseller, Reel, Locale |
| **Support/Ops agents** | 2/10 | Ticket, Forge, Shelf, Prime, Deliver, Purchase |
| **Governance agents** | 2/10 | Grade, Learn, Shield, Echo, Warden, Cleared, Gavel, Sentinel, Tinker |
| **3D Design agents** | 2/10 | Blueprint (3D), Current (PCB), Spark (RF), Ground (Test), Flux (Power) — hardware project stalled |

**Issues:**
- 50+ agents defined but producing zero visible output
- Many are department "overhead" agents scheduled daily/weekly with no evidence of work product
- Hardware/EE agents (Current, Spark, Ground, Flux) are irrelevant to current software-only ventures
- Finance agents have no access to real financial data or accounting systems
- Sales agents have no CRM integration (no HubSpot, no pipeline visible)
- Agent hierarchy is flat — no parent/child delegation structure visible
- `theo`, `raj`, `sam`, `drew`, `maya` agent INBOX files exist with no visible routing

**Improvements:**
- Archive or consolidate 50+ ghost agents
- Create a clear agent hierarchy: strategic (5) → tactical (10) → operational (15) = 30 max
- Integrate Finance agents with real accounting (Stripe, bank feeds)
- Integrate Sales agents with a CRM
- Remove hardware/EE agents until hardware project is重启

---

## ⚡ AUTOMATIONS — Score: 6/10

**What works:**
- Nightly/evening sprints (22:00 UTC, 16:00 UTC) ✅
- 5-minute AgentOS runner scheduler ✅
- Hourly Pulse health checks ✅
- Hourly Sentinel security scans ✅
- 48-hour GitOps checks ✅
- Daily department standups (8:15 AM weekdays) ✅
- 24-department sync every 2 days ✅

**What doesn't:**
- Database backup has had failures (log shows fixes applied)
- Gmail reminder still firing despite `gmail_setup_complete: true`

**Issues:**
- 75 agents all firing independently — no orchestration priority
- No dependency graph — agents can fire before their dependencies complete
- No deduplication — multiple agents doing similar work (Blueprint + Grader = two agents for one workflow)

**Improvements:**
- Prune ghost agents to reduce noise
- Build dependency chains for agent workflows

---

## 🌐 zo.space ROUTES — Score: 8/10

**68 routes total.** Active deployment is strong.

**Working routes:**
- `/invest` ✅
- `/investor-deck` ✅
- `/investor-portal` ✅
- `/projects/irrig8` ✅
- `/projects/valleyplayersclub` ✅
- `/projects/rain` ✅
- `/war-room` ✅
- `/govcon` ✅
- `/starting5` ✅
- `/aos` (private) ✅
- All VPC investor flows (send-code, verify, subscriptions) ✅
- AgentOS Android API routes ✅

**Concerns:**
- 68 routes is a large surface area — no route audit/consolidation
- Some routes reference old branding or abandoned projects
- No consolidated `/projects` landing page
- `/grants` page exists but content quality unknown
- `/mesh` route exists but MCP mesh project is still in dev

**Improvements:**
- Consolidate orphaned routes
- Audit each route for current accuracy

---

## 🔧 SERVICES — Score: 7/10

**Running:**
- `agentos-mobile` ✅ (https://agentos-mobile-brodiblanco.zocomputer.io)
- `vpc` ✅ (https://vpc-brodiblanco.zocomputer.io)

**Missing:**
- No `irrig8` service running (the-irrig8-project has no deployed service)
- No `rain` service (only the zo.space page)
- No AgentOS backend as a proper service

---

## 🔴 BRAND CONSISTENCY — Score: 3/10

**Irrig8 contamination: 71 files still reference "Irrig8"**

Active leaks:
| File Type | Count | Status |
|---|---|---|
| `.md` files | 61+ | Must audit/replace |
| `.tsx` files | 4+ | Must audit/replace |
| `.ts` files | 6+ | Must audit/replace |

Key contaminated locations:
- `Bxthre3/grants/` — all batch files reference Irrig8
- `Bxthre3/sprints/` — engineering reports reference Irrig8
- `the-irrig8-project/farmsense-code/` — entire directory needs archiving
- `the-irrig8-project/docs/` — manual/html pages reference Irrig8
- Agent instructions — 30+ agents still say "Irrig8 ((retired brand))" or just "Irrig8"
- Investor materials — some still have Irrig8-era branding

**Rule violations:**
- Irrig8 was officially retired 2026-03-23
- Irrig8 is the only canonical product name
- This is a non-negotiable brand rule being violated in 71+ files

**Improvements:**
- Run `find + sed` replacement across all `.md`, `.tsx`, `.ts`, `.py` files
- Audit all agent instructions for Irrig8 references
- Create a canonical "Irrig8" brand guide and distribute to all agents

---

## 📬 INBOX SYSTEM — Score: 5/10

**What's built:**
- 3-layer routing (agent → department → canonical INBOX) ✅
- 14 agent INBOX files ✅
- 22 department INBOX files ✅
- Routing script exists ✅
- P0/P1 → SMS rule ✅

**What's broken:**
- P0 escalation rule configured but never tested
- Many agent INBOX files (`theo`, `raj`, `sam`, `drew`, `maya`) have no visible purpose
- No evidence that department INBOXes are being actively read
- INBOX_ROUTING.py only handles messaging — no file-based handoffs
- No canonical INBOX audit — P0_REMEDIATION_PLAN.md exists but not linked to routing

---

## 📋 DOCUMENTATION — Score: 5/10

**What's good:**
- Supermemory exists with patterns + assessments
- SOUL.md exists at workspace root
- PROJECT_MANIFEST.md exists
- P0_REMEDIATION_PLAN.md exists
- Multiple sprint BRIEFs generated

**What's missing:**
- No master README at workspace root
- AGENTS.md at workspace root exists but may be outdated
- No clear onboarding doc for new agents
- No data dictionary for what each agent should produce
- No system architecture diagram (beyond individual project docs)

---

## 💰 FINANCE/EQUITY MATERIALS — Score: 4/10

**Known issues from prior sessions:**
- VPC share math was wrong across multiple PDFs
- Irrig8 vs Irrig8 brand contamination in financial decks
- Private terms (2.5%) were exposed publicly on VPC pages
- Equity minimums for cash partners (1%) vs standard investors were conflated

**Improvements:**
- Full audit of all VPC investor materials for share math accuracy
- Ensure all public-facing financial info is approved
- Separate cash-partner terms from standard investor terms
